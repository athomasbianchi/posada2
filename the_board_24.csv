1,1,"Jackson Holliday","BAL","2B","ST",2025,"70","Med",,"20.6388888","6' 0""","185","L","R",2022,"Draft","BAL",8190000,"Stillwater HS (OK)","This is the fourth coat of paint applied to Holliday's scouting report in the last couple of months. Jackson was shot out of a cannon in his first full pro season and slashed .323/.442/.499 across four levels, ending the season with Triple-A Norfolk at age 19. Despite being three to five years younger than the typical player at High- and Double-A, Holliday had 101 walks, 51 extra-base hits, and 24 stolen bases last year. Again, this was a teenage shortstop's first full professional season. Now 20, Holliday and the entire Norfolk lineup began the 2024 season on a collective tear while the Orioles were getting little production from second base. Holliday was promoted, hit .059 during a two-week big league trial, and was sent back down. It was the first hiccup he has experienced as a pro, maybe ever. He only sort of bounced back after the demotion, slashing .252/.418/.429 in the time between when he was sent back to Norfolk and when he was put on the IL with elbow inflammation in mid-June. Holliday returned from the IL just a couple of days before list publication. 
In a way, the IL stint was comforting because it offered a potential explanation for why Holliday's performance and ferocious bat speed had tapered off a bit. Holliday’s spray chart shifted away from his pull side and moved toward left field and the third base line in the weeks leading up to his shelving. He was inside-outing lots of contact the opposite way, including pitches on the inner third of the plate that he typically turns on, and it was taking what appeared to be an uncomfortable and excessive amount of effort for him to swing hard. We do not think there is any reason for panic here, or even a reason to reshuffle the top of the overall prospect list despite the presence of several other great young players at the top. 
Jackson is unbelievably talented in terms of his plate discipline, coordination, and in-the-box athleticism, and it's amazing that he reached the big leagues at age 20. He has a big, slow leg kick, takes a huge stride forward, and has loose and explosive hips and hands that helped him post a 45% hard-hit rate last season (neck and neck with Wyatt Langford, even though Jackson is a couple years younger). Even though Holliday's stride can sometimes pull him off toward first base, he finds ways to get his arms extended to cover the outer edge of the plate anyway. He's a very special young hitter, though there are a couple of nits worth picking; it is the very top of the prospect list after all. Holliday struggled to pull fastballs in 2023 and slugged less than .400 against them, per Synergy. Holliday's measurable power is, in most respects, pretty comfortably below the big league average at the moment even though he just got done slugging .490 last year and is slugging .470 at Norfolk right now. 
He also isn't currently a big league-quality shortstop defender and definitely isn't better than Gunnar Henderson, though his elbow injury might have something to do with that. Healthy Holliday's ability to make accurate throws from odd platforms is impressive, as is his poise and internal clock. He’s most comfortable throwing on the move and often goes out of his way to do so even when it isn't called for. Holliday lets a lot of choppers take an unnecessarily high hop, with the direction of that hop sometimes surprising him. He needs to do a better job of staying low and attacking this type of ball in play closer to the ground. We've altered his defensive projection to second base because it's where Holliday is most likely to play with Gunnar around. It's typical for players Holliday's age to need to make some adjustments and it appears that's what a hopefully healthy Holliday will spend the rest of 2024 doing. He has all of the scout-y athletic traits that indicate most of where he currently falls short will improve as his body matures. It might take a year longer than Orioles fans want it to, but Holliday is very likely to become a 5-WAR middle infielder who does everything well.","kLSYztort4s","31781"
2,1,"Wyatt Langford","TEX","LF","MLB",2024,"65","Med",,"22.6916666","6' 1""","225","R","R",2023,"Draft","TEX",8000000,"Florida","Langford graduated as the no. 2 prospect in baseball. Despite his slow-ish start to the regular season, I wasn't inclined to move him down, or to move Paul Skenes or James Wood (who have the same FV grade as Langford) ahead of him. This guy's ability to clean out velocity around his hands is on a different level than all but a few big league hitters, and the fact that he was in the big leagues after playing a little over a month of minor league games is incredible. I'm not especially worried that his rookie season, which was interrupted by a May IL stint for hamstring tightness, has been middling so far. Here is his report from the offseason: Langford slugged an incredible .719 as a sophomore at Florida, a remarkable feat considering he barely played the season before. Then he slashed .373/.498/.784 as a junior and solidified himself as a top-three talent in a loaded draft. After he signed, Langford lit pro ball on fire for the better part of two months, slashing a combined .360/.480/.677 as he climbed all the way to Triple-A. During that 200 PA span, Langford's underlying TrackMan data was so good that you could use it to spearhead an argument that he should be first on the overall prospect list, with plus measurable power and plate discipline, as well as an 81% contact rate. If you buy that Langford is actually that good, then he's perhaps the most complete hitter in the minors. 
It's rare for hitters to hit the ball both as often as Langford has and as hard as he does, even among big leaguers. Buff and twitchy, the short-levered Langford's arms are nearly as thick as they are long; Mike Trout is a fair body comp. His compact swing allows it to enter the hitting zone very quickly, enabling him to stay short to the ball and crush letter-high pitches, which is how he does most of his extra-base damage. Langford is apt to swing inside pitches on the outer third of the plate, perhaps because his levers are so short and he can't reach out there, and also because he's a bit of a bucket strider whose style of swinging is pretty common around baseball (Davis Schneider and a bunch of other Blue Jays swing like this, Henry Davis too). Langford's lower half is quite flexible and strong, and so are his hands. He has titanic power and is much better than a lot of the other top prospects at turning on velocity. 
Langford is also incredibly fast for a player his size, and some of his home-to-first times are a 70 on the scouting scale. Even though he has the speed for center and has played there a little bit, his feel for the position (and for playing outfield defense in general) is very poor. He's simply not comfortable out there, but his pure speed gives him a shot to be an impact defender if he can find his footing over time. Langford is a much more dangerous hitter than Jackson Holliday is right now. His power is fully actualized and he's much more likely to play an impact big league role from the jump than Holliday is, especially if the Rangers just DH Langford. Risk that this might happen anyway, especially with Leody Taveras and Evan Carter both around, is why Langford slots in as prospect no. 2 overall.",,"33333"
3,1,"James Wood","WSN","CF","ST",2025,"65","High",1,"21.8527777","6' 7""","240","L","L",2021,"Draft","SDP",2600000,"IMG Academy","Wood is one of only a couple minor leaguers with such immense physical potential that they have a realistic shot to be an elite, perhaps generational player, or at least a player of singular ability. Like Elly De La Cruz and Oneil Cruz before him, Wood has issues that threaten to undermine his profile, but he's so overtly gifted that he's one of only a few prospects with a realistic shot at being a 70-grade player or better on tools. 
Wood was a divisive amateur prospect, with some scouts seeing him as a center fielder with elite raw power projection and others seeing him as an eventual first baseman with hit tool risk. He was unbelievable out of the gate as a Padres prospect; he only struck out 17.8% of the time at Lake Elsinore and hit .337/.453/.601 before the Padres traded him to Washington as part of the Juan Soto blockbuster, after which he hit .293/.366/.463. He did this amid multiple wrist injuries, which is something to keep in the back of our collective mind in the event that it becomes a chronic issue, as Wood's wrists are an integral part of keeping his swing short enough to be manageable. Hit tool cracks were more evident in 2023, as Wood struck out in 32% of his PAs and was especially flummoxed by changeups, but he still managed to hit .262/.353/.520 with 62 extra-base hits. Early in 2024, he's cut his strikeout rate back down into the teens during an epic April and May at Rochester.
Because of how long-levered Wood is, it's likely he'll always strike out a lot, but he's surprisingly dangerous on the inner third of the plate for a guy with his build. He's shown flashes of covering high-and-away fastballs with power, as well as an ability to alter his posture to spoil soft stuff away from him, but he does neither of these consistently right now and those are the ways in which he's most vulnerable to whiffs. Once his wrist and forearms get stronger, he might be able to be a little shorter to the ball without sacrificing power, and early in 2024 it looks as though exactly this is happening. 
Wood is also surprisingly agile on defense. He takes a little while to get his legs churning, but once he's moving, he's a plus runner and has generated some home-to-first times in the neighborhood of 4.1-4.2 seconds. His huge strides enable him to cover a ton of ground in center field, and it's incredible that he not only has a chance to play there, but could be quite good for at least a little while. Wood looks super smooth going into the gaps and approaching the wall. His poise and feel for center are both currently superior to Dylan Crews', but it's much more typical for a compact athlete like Crews to stay up the middle for the long haul. Wood currently carries 240 pounds like a young Marcedes Lewis and is likely going to add weight commensurate with his frame as he matures, which might mean 30 pounds or more. The way that shakes out will have a significant impact on his defensive future. That said, Wood is already defying convention by looking as good as he does out there at his current size. In a lot of ways, Wood's report reads like a young Adam Dunn's, though we'd expect Wood to play better defense even if he ends up in an outfield corner. Admittedly a less stable hitter than a lot of the other elite prospects in baseball, Wood's ceiling is on another planet.","b32UDJr1jmk","29518"
4,1,"Paul Skenes","PIT","SP","ST",2024,"65","Med",,"22.1527777","6' 6""","235","R","R",2023,"Draft","PIT",9200000,"LSU","Skenes is a ready-made, front-of-the-rotation starter who has yet to experience any kind of a speed bump in pro ball. He entered the season as the best pitching prospect in the sport and has only gotten better. His new splitter/sinker and increased changeup usage and feel are meaningful developments, and put him in rarified air for a pitching prospect. He is one of only five pitchers who has ever been given an FV grade this high at FanGraphs and he has done nothing but reinforce that grade as he dominates big league opponents. A Herculean physical presence with even bigger stuff, he is perhaps the most important part of an increasingly promising situation in Pittsburgh, a city whose baseball team has made three playoff appearances over the last 30 years. 
Almost exactly two years ago, Skenes was still a two-way player at Air Force. His velocity climbed throughout that season, and at its conclusion a decision loomed as to whether he’d return to the Air Force Academy for a third year and effectively be locked into a two-year service commitment, or use the relatively new transfer portal rules to facilitate a one-year launching pad to pro baseball at a bigger program. Skenes transferred to LSU and was a member of the 2023 College World Series champions, a veritable All-Star team with several high-profile transfers, the closest thing college baseball has had to a Fab Five of its own. Though he was a first round prospect at Air Force, Skenes’ stuff, consistency, and physicality all took a leap at LSU. He ascended toward the very top of draft boards and was a justifiable first overall pick. His stuff was good enough for him to immediately compete with, if not overwhelm, major leaguers, but the Pirates gave Skenes some very specific developmental boxes to check before he was promoted. Namely, Skenes made his first ever start on four days’ rest (college starters pitch once a week). He debuted less than a year after he was drafted, at age 21.
All of this happened very quickly, and Skenes has been evolving and progressing the entire time. His velocity has been creeping north pretty consistently for the past two years, even now. His 2024 average fastball velocity (99 mph, peaking at 102) is up a tad compared to 2023. He tends to use his fastball as a finishing pitch and more evenly mixes in his panoply of secondary stuff early in counts. So far Skenes has paired this fastball most often with a hard slider. This was pretty comfortably his go-to secondary pitch in college. He manipulates the shape and velocity of it depending on what he’s trying to execute. It can bend in around 83-86 mph and act as a strike-stealing curveball, or it can peak around 90-92 mph and look more like a cutter. Traditional sliders are sandwiched somewhere between those two other pitch types. Because Skenes delivers from a lower slot, there are times when he gets around the side of his slider too much, and the pitch lacks the two-plane break of an untouchable one, but hitters have to be so keyed up to hit his 99-100 mph fastballs that they often whiff at those lesser sliders anyway. It’s maybe a plus pitch purely on stuff, but the east/west interaction Skenes’ slider has with his fastball and his ability to sculpt the shape of his breaker to the situation will probably help it play up. 
We qualify Skenes’ slider as “his go-to secondary pitch in college” because his changeup usage has taken a leap in pro ball. Not only that, but Skenes has essentially developed a second changeup. He has a more traditionally gripped changeup from his amateur days, but he’s added a mid-90s “splinker” à la Jhoan Duran of the Twins and José Soriano of the Angels. It’s a modified two-seamer that uses something approaching a splitter grip. Skenes tends to pronate over the top of his traditional changeup. The baseball comes off his middle and ring fingers to create movement that bottoms out below the zone. This type of release actually imparts some spin on the baseball, so Skenes’ changeups tend to live in the low 90s at about 2,100 rpm, while his splinker sits more in the mid-90s, spins less (closer to 1,800 rpm), and has more tailing action toward the knees of right-handed hitters. The rate at which Skenes has learned some of these new tricks (including the way he changes position on the rubber depending on hitters’ handedness) is very exciting. This guy is better now than he was a year ago, when he was the first overall pick in the draft. He looks like one of the best handful of pitchers in the sport.",,"33677"
5,1,"Jackson Chourio","MIL","CF","ST",2024,"65","Med",,"20.3694444","5' 11""","198","R","R",2021,"J2","MIL",1900000,"Venezuela","Chourio, who turns 20 in March, has been among the very best prospects in baseball for the better part of the past 18 months. He turned 19 just before the start of the 2023 season and slashed .280/.336/.467 in 122 games at Double-A Biloxi before the Brewers gave him a six-game shot of espresso at Triple-A Nashville in late September. His power, speed, and, more recently, his improvements on defense give him rare upside as a 30/30 threat and plus center field defender. During the offseason, Milwaukee signed Chourio to an eight-year (plus two options), $82 million contract that could earn Chourio as much as $140 million depending on whether those options are exercised. 
Chourio checks most of the boxes from a visual scouting standpoint. He’s a plus-plus runner (routinely 4.10 from home to first, at times a jailbreak 4.00 seconds flat) who has grown into being a great center field defender even though the former second baseman has only played there full-time for two seasons and change. He also has plus-plus bat speed and is capable of putting balls into the seats to all fields. The length of his swing might make it tough for Chourio to catch up to major league velocity up around his hands, and there’s a rigidity to the way his hands work that we don't love, which is where the little bit of hit tool risk comes from. But Chourio’s talent is so electrifying that even if he’s a flawed contact hitter, he’s still going to do enough other stuff at a high level to be a star player.
Plus, it’s encouraging that Chourio’s strikeout rate has improved since early in 2022, when he first began using this high-octane swing. It’s possible he’s just getting better feel for this relatively new style of swinging over time and that everything will be fine. He’s also developed a more dynamic approach during the last two seasons and is now cutting out his leg kick with two strikes. Because he’s already shown the aptitude to make adjustments like this, we can expect that he'll be able to shorten up his swing if it turns out he needs to. Again, whatever qualms we have with Chourio’s swing he makes up for with his bat speed (which enables him to smash fastballs he’s a bit late on toward the opposite field) and the power he generates on contact. The Baby Acuña comps are a little overzealous, as Chourio’s body and athletic style are both much more tightly wound than Ronald Acuña Jr.’s. Indeed, from a build and swing standpoint, Bo Bichette is a more apt comparison.","c5gspkixrs0","28806"

He was tasked with a move to center field in the wake of the Juan Soto/Trent Grisham trade and, despite having never played there before, took to it quickly. I updated my thoughts on his defense in April and Merrill returned to top 10 overall prospect status. He's had an incredible rookie season (as of the All-Star break, he's slashing .282/.315/.440 with 12 bombs and his expected stats are even better than that) and is easily going to set a single-season career high for homers. Merrill has one of the prettiest swings in baseball and it's feasible that the 21-year-old will come into more raw power as he matures. He's a special player who the Padres signed for an under-slot bonus. They supposedly had him ahead of Marcelo Mayer on their draft board that year and absolutely nailed it. This is a franchise center fielder (who knows, though, he might return to short one day) with a special bat. He's one of the best young hitters in the game.","-JmCUHgebC4","29490"
7,1,"Jordan Lawlar","ARI","SS","ST",2024,"60","Med",,"22.0194444","6' 1""","200","R","R",2021,"Draft","ARI",6710000,"Jesuit Prep HS","The highly touted Lawlar hit .263/.366/.474 in 89 games at Double-A Amarillo before he was quickly promoted up the rest of the ladder for a September call-up to Phoenix. The Diamondbacks only gave him about a week and a half of regular at-bats before he shifted into a pinch-running and defensive replacement role down the stretch and on Arizona's playoff roster. They perhaps should have given him more runway to adjust to big league pitching with the hope that Lawlar could quickly become a more threatening hitter than Evan Longoria and Emmanuel Rivera were in October, but the Snakes was fighting for their playoff lives and didn't have the luxury to roll the dice. Lawlar ruptured a ligament in his thumb during 2024 spring training and his initial recovery timeline was eight to 10 weeks, which would put him on pace to return in June.
Lawlar posted career-best strikeout rates at Double- and Triple-A in 2023, but he still has a pretty grooved swing and his underlying contact data on the season is near the very bottom of the everyday shortstop population (73% contact rate, 81% z-contact%), so we're sticking to a below-average hit tool projection here. But Lawlar does everything else very well. He's a stellar shortstop defender with premium range and defensive athleticism. His throwing stroke to first base can sometimes look a little odd, but he finds all kinds of crazy ways to contort his body and send the baseball where it needs to go, which is especially true of his feeds to second base. He has rare power for a shortstop (let alone a really good defensive one), plus plate discipline, and what is approaching elite baserunning speed. Not only did Lawlar show top-of-the-scale sprint speed in the big leagues (not our favorite way of assessing runners, but still), but his swing's natural jailbreak, à la Rickie Weeks Jr., puts his home-to-first times in the 4.10 second range pretty regularly. His hit tool isn't enough of an issue to threaten the rest of his profile — Dansby Swanson's contact rates in 2023 were nearly identical to Lawlar's combined stats, but he plays great defense and hits for power, and Lawlar should too. 
With Eugenio Suárez now entrenched at third base, it will be interesting to see how the Diamondbacks integrate both Lawlar and Geraldo Perdomo into their big league lineup assuming both are healthy at the same time later this year. Ketel Marte could be deployed as a DH more often, and Perdomo could move around (he has more experience doing so than Lawlar) as well as sit against lefties. Lawlar is a foundational player who should be a multi-time All Star and one of the faces of the franchise for the next five-plus years.","2OR5zWimpHc","29976"

He mashed his way across five minor league levels in two years and reached the big leagues in 2023 just a couple months after his 20th birthday. In 2023, he slashed .324/.384/.591 over 36 games at High-A Bowling Green and 81 for Double-A Montgomery, striking out 19.6% of the time and drawing walks at a 8.2% clip on his way to 55 extra-base hits (31 bombs!) at just 19-years-old. He also got a taste of big league pitching, appearing in seven games for the Rays. This year, Caminero has been in Durham, where Baseball Savant has his expected statline pegged at .259/.332/.463. His strikeout rate (23% — Cami has tended to K in the 14-18% range as a pro) is slightly higher than we're accustomed to seeing from him, though that's to be expected given both some swing issues we're about to get into and that he's facing savvy Triple-A pitching as a 20-year-old. 
Caminero already has plus-plus bat speed and raw power, and swings with bloodthirsty effort. He hits out of a crouched, open stance, and utilizes a leg kick and rhythmic hand hitch as his timing triggers. He loads his hands super deep and high, which often causes him to be late into the hitting zone against fastballs, but his bat speed is so ridiculous that he's still able to torch deeper-travelling heaters to the opposite field with home run power (he hit a ball 117 mph this year). Caminero's cacophonous cut leaves him vulnerable to good velocity up around his hands, which is where he does a lot of his swinging and missing. His breaking ball recognition and overall plate discipline are both pretty crude, but his feel for contact has carried enough water to keep him from having any significant strikeout issues so far. 
Caminero began to transition from shortstop to third base in 2023, and candidly, he did not look good playing third in winter ball for Escogido during the offseason. We had him projected to right field off this look, but he looked better in 2024 before Caminero suffered a Grade 2 quad strain at the end of May (he hasn't yet returned as of this update). Caminero is somewhat limited in his lateral range and quick-twitch traits, but his hands and arm strength should allow him to be an average defender at the hot corner. His throwing accuracy can be a bit shaky at times, especially when throwing on the run, and obviously we want to see how mobile he is coming off of this injury, but we've altered his position projection compared to the offseason Top 100 list here. How the Rays handle his ultimate position might be influenced by Isaac Paredes' continued level of production at third. It's more likely Cami will get DH reps if the Rays deem him worthy of a big league roster spot. Regardless of his position, and though there might need to be some adjustments against inside fastballs, this guy has incredible offensive talent and is going to be a middle-of-the-order force.","jgEhA6bbNE8","28163"

After he got off to a slower start in 2024 (and also didn't catch until May), Basallo has been on a heater for the last six weeks and has a well above-average offensive line at Bowie as of list publication. Basallo is a power-hitting kaiju catching prospect who looks like a gear-wearing Rafael Devers. His swing looks a lot like Devers', and he too has plus-plus power projection, a penchant for expanding the zone, plus arm strength, and some profound defensive flaws. Lackadaisically listed at 180 pounds, Basallo actually carries around closer to 240 pounds like a high school defensive end. He has preposterous bat speed and rotational athleticism for a hitter his age and size, let alone for a potential catcher. His peak exit velos and hard-hit rate are already plus on the big league scale, and that data was generated by a teenager at High- and Double-A the last two years. He does tend to chase and over swing, which is why even though Basallo hasn't posted excessive strikeout rates in the minors yet (just north of 20% so far in 2024), his hit tool is projected south of average against big league pitching. If he gets to as much power as we think he will and also catches, that's not going to matter very much.
We got a little better idea of what Basallo could do behind the plate last year when he got a full season of reps. When you look at his 2024 positional splits as of this update, he has spent a pretty even amount of time at catcher, first base, and DH, but he's been catching more frequently as the season has dragged on and tends to go two or three days in a row behind the plate before a recovery day at 1B or DH. His arm strength is great and there were times last year when it looked incredible, but Basallo has been popping closer to 1.95 so far this year and his footwork is often pretty sloppy. As is true of a lot of catchers his age, he could stand to be more accurate and consistent coming out of his crouch. His receiving isn't good, but it isn't so terrible that it damns him to first base. His ball blocking might though, and it's this area of Basallo's game that most needs to improve. If this skill doesn't progress, or if his size quickly forces him to move out from behind the plate, then his issues with chase would suddenly become more of a problem, though we're probably still talking about a strong enough hit/power combo for Basallo to be an everyday first baseman. 
Basallo's chalk 40-man evaluation year is 2025. He's been promoted ahead of that pace so far, but it's pretty rare for catchers with his issues to be in the express lane to the big leagues. If the Orioles just want access to Basallo's bat and decide to fast track him as a DH, or proactively move him to first base knowing Adley Rutschman is in place as the franchise catcher for a while, then a late 2025 debut feels possible. If the Orioles want to give Basallo the best chance of having immediate success as a big league catcher, then he's more likely on a late 2026 or spring 2027 trajectory. There are few other prospects in the minors who have this kind of offensive ceiling and a chance to play a premium position.",,"sa3015716"

He was the top unsigned high schooler from the 2020 class, a toolshed who swung and missed on the summer showcase circuit more than teams felt comfortable with. He ended up at LSU rather than in pro ball and was immediately dominant as a freshman, generating exit velos in excess of 100 mph on 17 of his first 30 balls in play and finishing with a .362/.453/.663 line that included 18 bombs. He followed that up by slashing .349/.463/.691 with 22 homers as a sophomore before hitting .426/.567/.713 with 18 bombs and more walks than strikeouts as a junior.
Crews can punish you to all fields. He'll get extended on fastballs away from him and crush them the opposite way, and he can also turn on slower pitches on the middle two-thirds of the plate and hit some titanic blasts to left. At times, the depth of Crews' hand load will leave him late on fastballs, and he's struggled pretty badly with heaters around his hands so far in 2024; he was striking out a third of the time through the first month of the season. The bend and strength in his lower body is incredible, and he might be able to shorten up what he's doing with his hands and still get to huge power because of how special the rest of his operation is. 
Crews will show you jailbreak-y, sub-4.1 run times, easily the speed to play center field, and his reads and routes (though still not great on balls hit in front of him) improved during his time in college after it first looked like he might be ticketed for right field. He sprints into the gaps with huge effort and is great at getting balls hit over his head. He should be an average big league center fielder, and his speed gives him bigger ceiling than that if his feel for the position continues to level up. Crews also does all kinds of little things well, be it procedural awareness on defense or how crisply he runs the bases. He's tooled up and performed at the highest level of amateur baseball for three years before finally meeting some resistance this year. The issues with fastballs around his hands are a little bit of a concern, so let's see if Crews can remedy those now that he's being challenged for the first time in his baseball life. We think he can, and that he'll be an impact player and franchise cornerstone.","yuOejbqs8OA","33541"

Salas, still just 16, was performing well in Double-A or big league ""B games"" against players who often had five to 10 years on him. After a few weeks in extended spring training (a level above where most 17-year-olds play), the Padres assigned Salas to Low-A Lake Elsinore just before he turned 17. He aced a two-month test there (122 wRC+), and the Padres promoted him to High- and then Double-A for the last several weeks of the season. 
Salas has struggled since leaving Lake Elsinore and has a 72 wRC+ as an 18-year-old at High-A Fort Wayne at the 2024 All-Star break. It's incredibly hard to contextualize that performance because Salas is not only very, very young for the level, but he's also playing a very demanding and punishing position. Salas is still a precocious defensive catcher. His receiving is advanced for his age, and the ease and accuracy with which Salas throws to the bases is remarkable, but he's regressed in one key area this year: His ball-blocking has been an issue. Right now, he often looks afraid of the baseball and is constantly bracing for impact when the pitch is in the dirt. He flinches and loses sight of the ball, seemingly hoping it finds its way into his glove on its own, but instead a lot of balls in the dirt are skipping past him and he's been doing a lot of running to the backstop in the weeks leading to this update. 
I'm still bullish on Salas' future as a hitter. There are aspects of his swing that have given one or two of my scout sources pause, with his length to the outer half chief among them. He still does a pretty good job covering the top half of the zone and is a dangerous hitter up there for an 18-year-old. This isn't a guy with monster bat speed, but he has a well-rounded blend of patience, in-zone contact, and what is presently doubles power. Salas isn't built like Elly De La Cruz or anything, but he's still quite projectable. He is probably going to be much thicker than he is now at maturity and it will be interesting to see how that bulk impacts his mobility and explosion as a hitter, be it positive or negative. His bat path is such that he struggles to elevate stuff down and away from him, and he has to get into his lower body pretty good in order to scoop low pitches at all. That's something else to watch as he fills out. The possibility of some kind of meteoric rise where Salas debuts as a teenager is starting to fade, but his long-term forecast as a franchise catcher has not. His underlying data supports the notion that this is still a precocious offensive player who is simply dealing with the rigors of his position (he's caught more games this year than all of last season) and a very difficult assignment for a prospect his age.","lUu9qAz-0-w","sa3020881"

He overpowered hitters with his fastball at the lowest levels, but by the end of the year, he was carving Double-A and looked like a fully-formed, four-pitch monster. He entered the spring of 2023 with a legitimate shot to break camp in the Phillies rotation, like a pitching version of Fernando Tatis Jr. a few years ago. Instead, Painter's elbow barked at him and he was shut down with a partial UCL tear after his first Grapefruit League outing. Painter and the Phillies opted for a plasma-rich platelet injection rather than an immediate Tommy John, which gave Painter a chance, with rest, to pitch at the end of a 2023 season in which the Phillies correctly anticipated that they'd be contenders. But Painter's elbow didn't heal completely from the PRP and rest, and he needed Tommy John toward the end of July; he isn't expected to pitch until 2025, per Dave Dombrowski. It's incredibly rare to value a prospect who will have missed two years this highly, but Painter has rare ceiling and the success rate of Tommy John surgeries is high enough to anticipate that he'll return to his old self. 
Healthy Painter has a prototypical pitcher's frame and then some, standing in at a broad-shouldered 6-foot-7 (which Painter has sculpted since his days as a high school prospect), a stature you'd more often associate with NBA wing players than pro pitchers. Doug Fister is a fair baseball body comp. Good luck getting on top of Painter's fastball when he locates it at the top of the zone. Even though he's so big and his pitches travel downhill toward the zone, it has still been hard for hitters to snatch his high fastballs, similar to the way Justin Verlander's fastball plays despite his size and release height. Painter will work six or more innings and never throw a fastball below 95 mph, sitting 96-98 for the bulk of the outing. 
Both of Painter's breaking balls have huge movement. His slider has two-plane sweep, while his curveball (more commonly used as an in-zone pitch and against lefties) is north/south and sometimes also has arm-side direction. If he can consistently create that arm-side finish on the curveball, it will give him a weapon against lefties. He had to whip out his changeup against upper-level hitters late in 2022, and some of those were quite good. Hitters seem to take more comfortable swings against his breaking stuff later in outings, so perhaps there's something about Painter's fastball angle that makes it easier for guys to see his breaking balls pop out of the hand once they've had a look at them. In a vacuum, though, he has a shot to have four plus pitches and an inning-eater's frame. If he looks like his late-2022 self upon his return from TJ, then Painter will rocket toward the top couple of spots on our universal prospect list.","sGWkF1MWSl4","sa3017880"

As of this update, he has been in Arizona swinging a bat for about a week. Carter missed most of the 2021 campaign with the same injury. I have tended to be lower on Carter than the consensus because I don't think he has huge physical tools and I feel more comfortable with him playing defense in left field than center, but he has elite secondary skills that buoy his performance. He graduates forecast as an above-average everyday left fielder. Here is his report from the offseason Top 100: In the Randy Arozarena vein, you just don't want to overthink this one now that Carter has shown what he's capable of in the game's most intense moments. We stayed relatively low on Carter (he was one of the top 50-FV players at the end of last year) for a while, considering him more of a soft skills left fielder than a likely star, noting Brandon Nimmo as a potential comp who became exceptional. It looks like Carter is, too. We don't expect he'll perform to the level he did during his god-like call-up — .306/.413/.645 in September, .300/.417/.500 in the playoffs — but he'll produce enough to be a very good left fielder in the event Leody Taveras hangs around to play center for the foreseeable future. 
Carter's plate discipline is incredible, and his nerves of steel were on display during the 2023 postseason, when he was very difficult for some of the best arms in baseball to make chase. He also has fantastic plate coverage and better ball-striking power on his more conservative swings than you'd expect from such a gangly and thin athlete. We don't think the league has taken complete advantage of Carter's issues against breaking stuff yet, especially back foot breakers, against which he was vulnerable in the minors. Carter struggles to contact these pitches when they're well-executed (he actually had many more swings-and-misses than balls in play versus breakers in 2023), but he can punish the ones that don't quite finish. 
Defensively, Carter does some things very well in center field and other things not so well. He’s great at running down balls in the gaps, and at finding the wall and then the baseball again as he approaches the warning track. His reads on balls hit in front of him aren’t as crisp (he'll make some diving plays in front of him that other center fielders make standing up), and his hands and ball skills are below-average. His arm plays above its raw grade because Carter’s exchange is so quick — he knows his best chance to hose someone is to get rid of the ball quickly and accurately, so he does. He’s definitely a fit in center field, but he isn't a Gold Glover or anything like that, and not as good as Taveras, which probably means Carter will be one hell of a left field defender for the next little while. Carter lacks the prototypical power of a starting left fielder, but his plate skills and speed are going to elevate his OBP enough to make him a very valuable player.","kn1p4E5tdTY","27790"

He ultimately fell to the White Sox at 22nd overall, and a little over a year removed from his selection, that looked like an absolute steal. Montgomery raked his way to Double-A in 2022, where he spent the last couple weeks of his first full pro season. His 2023 got off to a delayed start due to oblique and back issues that kept him on the complex in Arizona until July. Once he was back, Montgomery posted some of the best surface-level stats (.287/.456/.484 combined across all levels) and underlying TrackMan data in all of minor league baseball. His lack of chase (just 16%!), and the quality and amount of contact he made (8% swinging strike rate, 113 mph max exit velo just to name a couple data points) had Montgomery looking, on paper, like a near-ready superstar. 
We think there's rare plate discipline and power for a lefty-hitting infielder here, but we're fairly resolved that Montgomery won't be a big league shortstop defender, and we have some reservations about his hit tool. Montgomery did not look good playing shortstop late in 2023, though we suppose you could argue he looked the way he did because he was still recovering from injuries that may still have been impacting his mobility. We buy that there's variance around this evaluation, but most of what Montgomery is doing on defense happens too slowly, and runners end up safe on otherwise routine plays. His hands and range are both comfortably below average, and 21-year-olds this size rarely stick at short. Montgomery hasn't played anywhere but shortstop yet in pro ball, so we have him speculatively projected to third base, where guys his size tend to wind up. 
Skepticism that his hit tool is as good as his 2023 data performance comes in part from Colson feasting on low-level pitching for a large portion of his 2023 output. His swing is also long and cuts through the bottom portion of the zone. On tape and in the Arizona Fall League, Montgomery struggled with belt-high fastballs and with barrel accuracy in general. Again, the on-base skills and power here carry so much water that we think Montgomery will still probably be an above-average everyday corner infielder (unless he moves to first base), but this evaluation is probably a shade below the general industry consensus based on our eyeball scouting.","9ENOdU2g0cI","sa3017170"

Jones then focused solely on hitting. After an understandably rusty sophomore year in which it looked like the game was too fast for him, Jones moved from first base to right field and became a full-time starter in his junior draft season. He tweaked his swing throughout the spring and began to look more comfortable with the pace and difficulty of SEC baseball, as well as his gigantic body. The Yankees took him late in the first round and put Jones in center field, and he reached Double-A Somerset in a power- and strikeout-laden first full pro season. 
Jones has enormous potential, with eventual 40-homer power in the tank, and I think over time he's going to be able to shorten up and still get to enormous pop. His previous two-way prospect status, the pandemic, his college injuries, and Jones' outlier size are all ""tip of the iceberg"" traits that suggest late development. The hit tool is the key variable here. There is probably going to be an initial adjustment period against big league stuff, but the two-way Jones' stride length helps him galavant around center field with promise. He has rep-based projection there because he hasn't done it for very long, but at his size, it's entirely possible that he'll get too big and slow to stay there by the time his feel for the position improves to the big league standard. Even though his swing has been simplified, there is always going to be a ton of swing-and-miss here because of Jones' lever length. His 2023 whiff rates were only about one standard deviation worse than what's typical of a big league center fielder, with an overwhelming majority of his misses coming at the top of the strike zone and against backfoot breaking balls. He needs to be able to lift the ball more to actualize all of that power, which might mean further simplifying his cut. 
I don't expect any of this will come together in a hurry, and Jones is still more of a risky developmental prospect with a huge ceiling than he is ready for the big leagues. But as far as ceilings go, in this case we're talking about St. Patrick's Cathedral. Jones is on a post-2025 40-man timeline and has only had a cup of coffee at Double-A. He could feasibly spend most of the next two seasons at Somerset and Scranton because, again, there are clearly things he needs to work on at this stage. <em>So</em> much of this depends on whether or not the Yankees are contending, but for now I'd expect a late-2025 call-up (preserving all of his option years), with the huge impact not arriving in a consistent fashion until 2027 or so.",,"sa3019969"

The Rays gave him a $2.3 million bonus to keep him from heading to Cal and have developed him solely at short. So far that looks to have been the correct assessment, as Williams has averaged 21 homers, 51 extra-base hits, and 24 stolen bases in each of his two full seasons of pro ball. He's on a similar pace in 2024 except he's stealing even more bases and with a better success rate. In 2023, he slashed .254/.351/.506 at High-A Bowling Green, with a smattering of games at Double- and Triple-A as well. Then Williams had a no good, very bad Fall League stint in which he struggled mightily to parse breaking balls. He seemed totally gassed and very frustrated, the type of Fall League look you just kind of throw out. 
That's not to say that Williams is a lock to hit. He's struck out more than 30% of the time so far in pro ball and has severe breaking ball recognition issues that we optimistically wants to project on as he continues to develop solely as a position player. There’s a lot of looseness throughout Williams’ swing, and he has a steep, lofty path that makes him vulnerable to pitches in the upper quadrant. But he already has big all-fields power (his peak exit velos are a 55 or 60 on the big league scale and Williams is still a pretty skinny 21 year old) that he consistently carries over into game action. That and premium defensive ability are the two attributes that support Williams' entire profile, and they become even more exciting when you consider his relative inexperience. 
Williams is an unbelievable athlete and flashy shortstop defender. He makes a lot of plays that no other shortstops do, as if his beginner's mind is conceiving of new ways to play the position. Few shortstop prospects match either his reads off the bat or the caliber of body control he displays, and Williams' plus-plus throwing arm makes it so no play is off limits for him to complete. Scouts are mixed as to whether Williams is actually projectable. Some consider him a little too thin and frail looking to project on, but they are in the minority, and here we have WIlliams projected for impact power. Williams' overall profile is that of a plus-power, plus-plus defender whose hit tool will be hindered by his lofty strikeout numbers, but the power/defense combo he brings to the table makes him one of the most exciting shortstop prospects in the sport.",,"sa3017795"

An extra tick of velocity compared to 2023, plus an improved changeup and command, elevated Jones into the top 20 overall prior to his graduation from rookie status. 
His four most used offerings are all generating at least a plus rate of swing-and-miss as Jones pumps his upper-90s fastball past hitters at the belt and then toys with them with either his cambio or slider. An elite on-mound athlete who was also a draft prospect as a third baseman, Jones' feel for release consistency has improved substantially since his time as a prospect. He's a little undersized, and all that's keeping him from the 60 FV tier, which is normally occupied by the best couple of pitching prospects in the entire sport, is some apprehension about his durability and a potential command regression because of how much effort it takes him to produce this kind of velocity. Regardless, he looks like an impact starter who's going to make several All-Star teams, a dream draft-and-dev success for a franchise that badly needs those to compete.",,"27863"

He had a somewhat rocky first full season in pro ball; his velocity was down a bit compared to his peak pre-draft look and he ran a FIP over 5.00 across 18 starts with Lakeland. Hitters seemed unphased by Jobe's trademark curveball despite its elite spin and huge depth. He struggled to throw strikes and the visual quality of his stuff regressed. Then Jobe was put on the IL to start 2023 and missed two and a half months recovering from lumbar spine inflammation, which is more a description of symptoms than a root cause, as this kind of inflammation can be brought on by arthritis, infection, or any number of other maladies. When Jobe returned in mid-June, he did so with a vengeance. Across 20 starts combined between the regular season and the Arizona Fall League, Jobe tallied 103 strikeouts and just 11 walks in 79.2 IP. His fastball velocity was living in the upper reaches of his career-long band, often touching 98-99. 
Perhaps more significantly, Jobe has scrapped his curveball. He now utilizes a firm 87-92 mph cutter and a low-80s sweeper, and has upped his changeup usage considerably. Both of his new breaking balls have the same elite spin Jobe could create on his curveball, though neither of them has consistent shape nor finish yet. Considering he's only used those new pitches for half a season and can spin them like he does, I'm projecting growth for both offerings. His changeup is arguably his most switched-on secondary now, as Jobe uses it against both lefties and righties. The changes he's made in response to the ineffectiveness of his 2022 breaking ball have made Jobe a more complete pitcher. Will we see this kind of velocity from him across 120-140 innings? And will Jobe's back issues be a persistent part of his career? These are reasonable things to wonder, but right now Jobe looks healthy, nasty, and fairly ready to pitch in the big leagues. Jobe isn't on the 40-man yet (he doesn't have to go on until after the 2025 season) and the Tigers have a ton of starter depth in front of him right now, but it's feasible that at some point in the middle of 2024, he'll be one of Detroit's best five healthy starters.","Q_q_xGJX-bU","30203"

He went 15-0 in 17 starts for Wake Forest prior to the College World Series and posted a sub-1.00 WHIP and sub-2.00 ERA, then did not pitch at an affiliate after the draft. He brings mid-90s heat, a plus-plus slider, and a potentially plus changeup to the party, and could be a mid-rotation option in Cincinnati by the middle of the 2024 season. 
A gangly, unspectacular athlete with a theatrical, cross-bodied delivery, Lowder clearly works hard to keep his somewhat awkward frame in great shape. His bow-legged front side and the stiffness in his hips and lower back contribute to a funky operation that aids in deception, albeit via an atypical look for a starter. But Lowder's touch and feel for location, especially of his breaking ball, is special. His best pitch is his upper-80s slider, which has considerable length for a breaking ball that hard. The sink/tail action of his fastball limits its bat-missing ability in the strike zone, but its movement pairs nicely with his slider and it's hard for hitters to cover both of those pitches when they're located well in sequence. Lowder's fastball also has utility running back over the glove-side corner of the plate, and he might be able to accentuate the sink on his fastball over time. 
Lowder has been in the 94-96 mph range this spring. His fastball/slider combo is very similar to Brady Singer's coming out of Florida, but Lowder's changeup has much more natural action and movement than Singer's did, and it flummoxed big league hitters during 2024 Cactus League and minor league spring training looks. This was the lone component that needed a little bit of development for Lowder to reasonably project as an impactful mid-rotation arm and it already seems to have arrived. He might obviously be the Reds' best starting pitcher by August.","G5z9DvzB05Y","33876"

While those changes may have been aimed at eliminating PCA's upper-zone swing-and-miss issues, they have instead resulted in a power surge over the past couple seasons the likes of which he'd never previously displayed. After sending out 16 bombs at Low- and High-A in 2022, he upped the ante in 2023 with 20 homers in roughly the same number of games, this time at Double- and Triple-A, where he was far younger than most of his competition. The upper- and outer-zone whiffs are still present, though, and while we think PCA is going to get to his power, it's likely that his hit tool and OBP skills will wind up comfortably below the big league average. That's been the case so far as Crow-Armstrong approaches 100 big league plate appearances.
But of course, PCA boasts some of the most electric center field defense in the sport and could be a nearly three-win player on that basis alone. His proficiency and fearlessness on the basepaths is undeniable – a significant portion of his doubles in 2023 were of the hustle variety – and as long as he's doing <em>something</em> offensively, he is going to be an impact big leaguer. He'll likely continue to be challenged by the upper-zone heaters that have long confounded him at the plate. If he can plug that hole over time, he'll be a five-tool superstar. More likely, he'll have some 20-25 homer seasons amid a ton of strikeouts and a low OBP, with peak years resembling Mike Cameron's (though almost certainly not to that level of annual consistency). He has assumed the Cubs' everyday center fielder role during Cody Bellinger's injury absence and initial return, but it's feasible he'll effectively be in a timeshare with Michael Busch and Patrick Wisdom as a fully healthy Bellinger shuttles back and forth between center field and first base.","W3x5HtsbK0U","27769"

He's a 22-year-old on a 30-homer pace at Triple-A and is poised to either threaten the playing time of Baltimore's incumbent corner infielders or be the centerpiece of a monster trade within the next year. Mayo's swing is weird and he's a flawed defender who still hasn't begun playing the position we think he might best be suited for, but he now has a five-year track record of mashing and is one of the higher-probability corner position prospects in the minors. 
Mayo executes a pull-and-lift approach geared for crushing mistakes in the upper two thirds of the strike zone, and he has succeeded with this approach all the way up the minor league ladder despite his sometimes ugly looking cut, which has a strange, choppy stride. If most hitters' strides back toward the pitcher are ""outies,"" Mayo's is an ""inny"" — his front foot often lands closer to his rear foot than where it began in his batting stance. All of his swing's components fire in a short period of time, and it's an odd look, but it works for him. He does, however, swing inside a lot of sliders, even ones that don't completely turn the corner. Mayo's strikeouts will likely climb against big league pitchers who can exploit this, at least initially, but he's going to get to such big power that it probably won't matter. 
There is still a lot of work to be done on defense here, as Mayo's size makes it hard for him to move around at third base. Unless he improves at first base (where his playing time was increasing prior to a mid-May fractured rib) or in right field (where Mayo has been speculatively projected here at FanGraphs for a while because of his impressive max-effort arm strength) pretty quickly, he's more likely going to debut because of injury or trade than Baltimore's needs. He projects to be one of the 10 to 15 most productive first baseman or corner outfielders in the game.","VSpXK_tYQAQ","28312"

He didn't have a ton of showcase experience, and while clearly a skilled hitter in the scant showcase PAs he did put on tape, he was a heavy-bodied first base prospect who'd need to mash to profile. Several teams drafting through around pick 60 or so were on Isaac, so the Rays weren't alone in liking him, and so far the pick looks great, as Isaac hit .285/.395/.521 with 19 homers in a first full season spent mostly at Low-A Charleston. Recently selected to the Futures Game, he's currently on pace for a 20/20 season and has a 156 wRC+ at High-A Bowling Green as of this update.
Isaac has pretty dramatically remade his body and now looks more like Nate Lowe than coaching-era Sidney Lowe. He's slimmed down without losing strength. On the contrary, he has added some and has a hard-hit rate around 60% this year. Isaac has rare fluidity in his hips and rotational explosion for a hitter his size, and while he is going to swing and miss at an elevated rate, he also has ridiculous power all over the strike zone. If you put Isaac's balls in play on tape, he's adjusting to all kinds of different pitches in different locations and using his immense strength to move the baseball all over the field. 
Look under the statistical hood and things get more complicated. Isaac ran a sub-70% contact rate in 2023 and is right around that mark again in 2024; only one qualified big league first baseman (Bryce Harper) did that in 2023 and none are currently that low in 2024. A couple of other successful role players (Luke Raley, Ryan Noda) were also in that range, but it's rare for a first baseman to run a contact rate this low and be successful. While Isaac's athleticism makes what he's doing in the batter's box look smooth and graceful, he probably has more going on with his swing than a young man of his prodigious strength needs to. He doesn't always track pitches well and he swings inside a lot of stuff on the outer third, especially changeups, which Isaac offers at early in part because his cut is so involved. The good news is we think Isaac will have such enormous power at maturity (he also has plus plate discipline) that he'll offset his contact issues. We also think there's a chance his hit tool progresses beyond its current state because we're talking about a young hitter who hasn't played against elite competition very much. We can't overstate how much power there is here — it's such enormous, flaw-covering juice that we're in Matt Olson territory as far as overriding our concerns about how many K's there are. If you’re in a dynasty league or collect prospect’s cards, you need to get this guy now. Isaac is still obscure enough that the photo service we use for header art doesn't even have a picture of him in its database yet, but if he continues on this pace against Double-A pitching in the second half of the year, he is going to finish the season as a top five or 10 overall prospect.",,"sa3020498"

The Cardinals have pushed him pretty aggressively and Winn began 2023 as a 21-year-old at Triple-A Memphis, where he slashed .288/.359/.474 and hit an uncharacteristically high 18 homers in 105 games. Winn made his big league debut late enough last year to retain prospect eligibility, which he has blown through in 2024, as he broke camp with the big league club. He graduates from rookie status playing about as well as expected. There will likely be meaningful power as Winn ages deeper into his 20s. For now, it's impressive that a small 22-year-old is holding his own at this level. Winn's hands on defense are only average, but he's a premium athlete capable of making acrobatic plays, and he has an elite arm. Because of his rare level of athleticism, the ceiling on Winn's power separated him from some of his contact-oriented middle infield peers on the Top 100. It will probably take a couple of years before he really peaks, but Winn projects to be a well-rounded player and a foundational piece in St. Louis.","C_Epe1MsiS8","27479"

As a minor leaguer, he would show you anywhere between 92-97 mph and it appears he's settled into the lower part of that range, at least for now. He generates a ton of fastball chase because of the pitch's angle and his delivery's deception. The thick-thighed southpaw throws from a low three-quarter arm slot and further lowers his release point by way of a deep knee bend as he lunges toward the plate. 
Harrison started 2023 at Triple-A and spent most of the year there (minus a few weeks on the IL with a hamstring injury) before joining the Giants’ big league rotation in late August. He broke camp in the rotation this season and has amassed enough innings to graduate from rookie status. Harrison has been surprisingly efficient so far as a big leaguer after he was rather walk-prone early in his pro career. He still has a big bending breaking ball that works best as a show-me pitch versus lefties, but his most-used secondary is now his changeup. Again, Harrison's changeup plays because of how often it's chased more than because of its pure swing-and-miss action. It often finishes in the middle/bottom of the zone rather than down and to his arm side like a normal changeup. We've made no changes to Harrison's offseason evaluation based on how he's looked so far. He continues to project as a mid-rotation mainstay.","1AlmnfSq0xE","27758"

He was drafted as a long-term project with a big frame (6-foot-3, 205 pounds), present arm strength, and a loose, efficient arm action that portended secondary pitch development. Smith-Shawver began to throw harder pretty quickly after he got to pro ball, with his riding fastball parked in the 93-96 mph range for entire starts in 2023 and peaking above. The Braves augmented his release point a little bit, and it created more lateral action on his formerly velo-reliant slider than that pitch had in 2022. It was one of a few changes that allowed Smith-Shawver to dominate A-ball and reach the upper minors very quickly. He and the Braves also added a mid-70s rainbow curveball that has a shape that complements his fastball; it often has a little arm-side action on it that should help make it a weapon against lefties as Smith-Shawver gets feel for it. 
Smith-Shawver spent most of 2023 at Triple-A Gwinnett, then got a five-start, six-game cup of coffee in Atlanta before making the Braves' playoff roster as a reliever. He dealt with bad HR/FB luck at Gwinnett early in 2024 but looked fine from a stuff standpoint and made one big league start before he was shut down with an oblique strain in late May. Since exiting A-ball, his surface stats have left a bit to be desired (especially from a strike-throwing standpoint), but consider the context here: Smith-Shawver made the bigs less than two years after being drafted as a two-sport high school athlete. He did so while undergoing meaningful mechanical and repertoire tweaks, tweaks he is still sorting through (his changeup usage was way up this season before the injury). Smith-Shawver also checks all the visual scouting boxes. He is built and moves like a workhorse mid-rotation starter, with a huge stride down the mound and a loose, efficient arm action. He needs to find a more consistent release point to hit his ceiling, but he has all the characteristics of an athlete who will. Smith-Shawver may have some early-career speedbumps, but he could have a star peak during a career mostly spent as a mid-rotation starter.",,"29960"

His pro career got off to a delayed start because of multiple health issues. He was diagnosed with myocarditis shortly after signing, which kept him out for all of 2021, and then a high grade hamstring strain put him on the IL for the first half of 2022. It wasn't until that June, two years after he was drafted, Kjerstad was finally cleared to be sent to an affiliate. He has been an offensive force of nature since returning to the field. He's a career .304/.386/.526 hitter in the minors who had 58 extra-base hits in 122 games before he made his big league debut during the last few weeks of the 2023 season. He's been up and down a couple times so far in 2024 and was promoted to Baltimore again a couple of days prior to list publication.
Kjerstad has monstrous all-fields power and enough feel for the barrel to weaponize it even though he tends to chase. His hands ignite in the blink of an eye, allowing him to turn on inside pitches with power and also to let outside pitches travel deep into the hitting zone before crushing them the other way. He has fantastic plate coverage but expands the zone too much, which is why he's projected as having a slightly below-average hit tool here. 
Kjerstad is still going to have enough in-game power to support an everyday corner profile despite a potentially low OBP, and his defense has surprisingly improved. When he first returned from injury in 2023, it looked as though he'd end up in the 1B/DH bucket. But Kjerstad has looked more mobile and athletic as he's gotten further away from his health and injury issues, and he now has average range and footspeed, though he still is not a very comfortable outfielder. It might a trade to clear the deck for Kjerstad to play every day in the near future. As long as their outfield is as crowded as it is right now, Kjerstad's role will most likely be in a timeshare with Ryan Mountcastle and/or Austin Hays. If Cedric Mullins' 2024 struggles continue and force him into a speed and defense role down the stretch, more PAs might open up. Kjerstad's lack of plate discipline gives his profile an element of risk, more than is typical for someone who has performed in the minors the way he has. But his combination of bat control and power is very special and should enable him to be a heart-of-the-order force at peak.","Kw_nkwAjQEs","31166"

Even though his early-2023 surface stats at Low-A Salem were mediocre, Anthony's underlying metrics indicated he was about to breakout via a potent combination of burgeoning raw power, extreme (if perhaps unsustainable) patience, and better bat-to-ball performance than one might have anticipated given his high school track record. He was promoted to High-A Greenville and his strikeouts exploded, but so did Anthony's power, and at age 19 he hit 12 homers in just 54 games before a brief Double-A stint to close the season. He also looked better in center field toward the end of 2023. Now 20 years old, Anthony has been at Double-A Portland all year and has kept walking a lot and hitting for power (despite a swing that isn't effectively geared for it yet) while his strikeouts have remained elevated. 
Anthony has filled out and become more physical in 2024, which has slowed him down enough to shift his defensive projection into a corner, though this was probably going to happen anyway given the presence of Jarren Duran and Ceddanne Rafaela in the org. The added strength has also manifested in bigger exit velocities. Anthony had average measurable raw last year (which is incredible for a 19-year-old) and now has pretty comfortably plus raw, maybe even plus-plus; his 55% hard-hit rate as of the date we sourced minor league Trackman data would slot in sixth among qualified big leaguers. Anthony's swing is almost a carbon copy of Rafael Devers' cut, with violent effort and a mostly downward swooping bat path that relies on bend in his lower body to go down and scoop low pitches with power like Devers does. While Anthony has shown some ability to do this (it's absolutely gorgeous when he does), he isn't doing so consistently. Opposing pitchers can limit his ability to get to power by approaching him in the bottom half of the strike zone, as he tends to drive those pitches into the ground, and soft stuff precisely located down and away from him often eludes him entirely. Anthony slugged .466 at mostly Low- and High-A in 2023, but his expected slugging percentage based on his quality of contact was only .370, per a front office source. There's been a little bit of a shift this year, with his average launch angle rising from six degrees to 10, but there isn't consistent lift here yet. 
Anthony's plate discipline evokes a baked good that has too much food coloring in it; there's an air of artificiality to it that makes it feel a bit unnatural. One team I source data from tracks players’ “cookie swing rate,” in essence the rate of swing when a pitch is right down the middle of the plate. Anthony's was among the lowest in the minors last year, and I think it speaks to a narrow early-count approach that perhaps includes premeditated takes rather than actual selectivity. His big league plate discipline will probably be slightly better than average, but he likely won't post the elite walk rates he's shown in the minors so far. The effort in Anthony's swing makes it likely that he'll always strike out at a pretty good clip, but there are plenty of really good big league corner outfielders, such as Riley Greene and Fernando Tatis Jr., with this kind of contact profile (right around 82% in the zone, 76% overall); it's just going to take continued swing adjustments for Anthony to get to star-level power in games. In the same way it took Duran a couple of years before everything clicked, it may also take Anthony a little time before he peaks as the All-Star power hitter he's projected as here. His FV grade hasn't changed, but I've repositioned Anthony somewhat on the top 100 list since it seems clearer he's destined for a corner. He slides a few spots into a group of similarly talented mashers, most of whom are also in the upper levels of the minors.",,"sa3020211"

He barely played as a freshman due to the pandemic, and a broken foot ended his uneven 2022 junior year early. DeLauter crushed the Cape prior to his draft year and was shy of 21 years old on draft day, so it seemed likely that model-driven teams were going to be all over him despite his weird looking swing (which at the start of 2022 was totally out of whack); it's unsurprising that Cleveland landed him in the first round. DeLauter didn't play pro ball after the draft and his 2023 got off to a delayed start because he had to have another surgery on his foot. He disemboweled High-A pitching once he returned (.366/.403/.549) and then looked great in the Arizona Fall League, where six weeks of watching DeLauter hit made it easier to believe in his swing. 
DeLauter's truncated finish through contact and the way his lower body interacts with his swing are both pretty weird to watch. He is adept at altering the posture of his body to manipulate the barrel around the zone rather than just do it with his hands. There's some risk he won't be able to do this as readily against major league velocity, which he really hasn't seen consistently yet. But even in instances where his swing isn't well connected, he's strong enough to hit the ball hard somewhere. While he's best at golfing low pitches, DeLauter is also capable of taking ones on the outer third deep to the opposite field. His background contact rates (88% z-contact%) and lack of chase both reinforce the hitterish scouting look. It's tough to call a hitter who has only played about 60 games a year for the last four years ""stable,"" but from a skills and tools standpoint, DeLauter feels that way. He's tracking like a middle-of-the-order mainstay. DeLauter's chalk 40-man clock puts him on pace for a September 2025 call-up, but he's performing so well during the spring of 2024 that he may kick down the door and debut this season.","m0sabnQwbiU","sa3021053"

De Paula's best swings are absolutely ferocious and he's going to develop huge raw power down the line, as he already has about average big league power right now. De Paula's explosive hands and beautiful, compact swing (especially for a hitter his size) are characteristic of a heart-of-the-lineup force, but poor barrel accuracy stifled his in-game power in 2023, and he hit just two homers in 74 Cal League games. There's more hit tool risk here than is obvious on the surface, as De Paula struck out just 18% of the time last season but really struggled against high fastballs and with mis-hitting crushable pitches into the ground. 
Again, the amount of juice De Paula is likely to grow into and how short to the ball he's able to be are enticing attributes that make us scared of undervaluing him here. He's grown an inch and added 25 pounds this offseason, according to Dodgers personnel. It's possible that gigantic breakout is coming, but because we're talking about a corner outfielder with hit tool risk, we're not ready to push all our chips in on De Paula until he at least proves the power will manifest in games despite it.","jTmamiOEoas","sa3018591"

His 2024 regular season got off to a delayed start due to a hamstring strain that Jenkins suffered in his first game at Fort Myers. He returned in late May, rehabbed on the complex for a bit, then returned to the Mighty Mussels roster. Jenkins' surface stats at Low-A leave something to be desired, but he looks fine. He has been incredibly difficult to make swing and miss since his return; Jenkins has only whiffed on tape (via Synergy) five times this year and two of them were in the first game of the year prior to his injury. 
Jenkins can move the barrel all over the zone with deft and explosive hands that spray hard contact everywhere. He looks most natural scooping low pitches, and because he's still just had A-ball experience, he hasn't been tested by big velocity at the top of the strike zone very often. Jenkins generates big power without an elaborate load of his hands, and it's amazing how much damage he can do with such a simple swing. He had one of the better contact and power blends among the hitters in the loaded 2023 draft, with above-average pop right now that projects to be at least plus at maturity. He doesn't run well enough to play center field and could move through the minors quickly if the Twins decide to put him in a corner and leave him there.

It seemed as though things were clicking for him at a different level toward the end of the 2022 college season and the Cubs were emboldened to select him seventh overall that year. In his 2023 pro debut, Horton posted a .996 WHIP across 88.1 innings and reached Double-A. Perhaps more influentially (as far as how Horton was measured against other prospects in the sport), he sustained the velocity surge he showed during his breakout junior year despite throwing more innings. 
That hasn't quite been the case so far in 2024, as Horton has lost about two ticks of fastball velocity in the early portion of the season; his heater is sitting more 92-95 rather than the 94-97 of last year. Horton is still pitching pretty well and was promoted from Tennessee to Triple-A Iowa after a couple of starts, but he isn't dominating. His breaking ball quality (both have mostly vertical movement and tend to be in the 83-87 mph range) is still plus, though he struggled to land it in his outing just before list publication. Horton's screwball-style changeup, usually 86-88 mph, flashes plus but he spikes a lot of them.

It's common for hitters returning from wrist injuries to experience a decline in power, and we didn't slide Mead at all on the offseason Top 100 list. Mead also underwent a pretty significant swing change in 2023, one that incorporated more movement in his lower body, and it's remarkable that he performed as well as he did amid both the injury and the changes. This was the second significant swing change for Mead in three seasons. He made his big league debut late last year and broke camp this spring on the big league roster, but the presence of Isaac Paredes at Mead's primary position, the addition of José Caballero, Richie Palacios, and Amed Rosario, and finally the return of Taylor Walls from injury led the Rays to demote Mead in May, and he's been in Durham since. He was up long enough to graduate, and he does so with some concern over whether his tendency to chase will hinder his offense. 
Healthy Mead blends plus in-zone contact with above-average power. He's much more athletic in the batter's box than he is on defense, and the way his swing unwinds from the ground up is beautiful and violent. We also love how much his top hand is involved in driving the quality of his contact. Historically, Mead has raked despite having a hyper-aggressive approach at the plate. His swing decisions against fastballs are still pretty terrible (39% chase this year), but his breaking ball chase has been close to average. Even since he's been back in Durham, he has been offering at stuff nowhere near the zone far too often. We want to be careful not to overreact to this. Mead is still only 23 and even though he's been in pro ball for half a decade, we still think his secondary skills have late projection because of his Aussie origins and the relatively brief time he's spent facing elite pitching. Corner defenders (especially middling ones like Mead) who have chase issues like this are risky no matter how well they're performing in the minors, but Mead's in-zone contact and power blend is still very potent; he's too talented to slide down the Top 100 list in a panic. 
The Rays deployed Mead at second base in their 2023 Wild Card round loss to the Rangers, but he looks better at third. He doesn't seem comfortable throwing back across his body, which second basemen have to do regularly but third basemen do not. He can be slow to approach grounders in front of him and is generally a slow-twitch athlete, but he's gotten much better at third base during the last two years and might continue to progress as he gets reps at Triple-A and big league speeds. An elbow sprain (which happened amid a throwing program to try to improve his arm strength) ended his 2022 and required a PRP injection, which is often a precursor to Tommy John for pitchers. That's a useful medical detail to file away but isn't something that's threatening Mead's profile. We still think Mead will be a good everyday third baseman over time, but obviously the Rays' situation at the hot corner is very crowded and Mead is starting to run out of option years, so he's also a prime candidate for a trade.","txl_FqwuORc","23986"

He hit the ground running as a pro, putting up disgusting numbers on the complex and then leapfrogging to High-A, where he racked up a 197 wRC+ over 20 games, before finishing the season with 15 games at Double-A, where Shaw has been assigned again to start 2024.
Shaw's pro Trackman data last year was elite: He posted a 91% zone contact rate and plus peak exit velos in a medium-sized post-draft sample. He hasn't been quite as amazing in the early stages of 2024 but, across a fairly small sample, he's been much more selective. Shaw is a powerful, short-levered hitter with really explosive wrists and an odd, max-effort swing that, so far, has worked for him. His quick hands allow him to barrel up offerings throughout the strike zone, but his odd bat path, which cuts down at pitches in the bottom of the zone, hasn't been tested by back-foot breaking stuff that could be a problem for him eventually. He has enough pop to torch contact the opposite way and is also a speedy dead-ahead runner, though Shaw's lateral range on defense is not as good. 
Having stuck to the middle infield as an amateur, Shaw has now seen pro reps at third base, where he has been playing most often in 2024. With Nico Hoerner and Dansby Swanson entrenched on the middle infield, Shaw's fastest path to Wrigley is through the hot corner. Still, there has to be substantial development on defense before Shaw is a big leaguer. He plays defense with a high center of gravity and his hands are a little bit clunky. There's a chance he isn't even an infielder at all, but if he works on his defense with as much effort as he brings to an actual game, then he should improve enough to stay there. Shaw's swing and tightly wound brand of athleticism are atypical looks on a baseball field, but his track record of hitting and hitting for power is that of an above-average regular.",,"sa3022615"

A plus on-mound athlete with a great arm action and a carrying fastball that was in the 93-95 mph range, he was an exciting, tip-of-the-iceberg dev project for a Padres system that had recent success with two-way and conversion arms, most prominently Luis Patiño. Then the Dodgers plucked him away in a trade for corner role player Matt Beaty in late March of 2022, and we started to see parts of the iceberg that lay beneath the surface during Ryan's first full season as a pro pitcher. He was more in the 95-97 mph range throughout 2022 and was dominant (if a little wild) across just shy of 50 total innings. In 2023, Ryan held mid-to-upper-90s fastball velo under the stress of twice as many innings. He posted a 3.33 ERA in 97 innings with Double-A Tulsa before two Triple-A starts ended his year. 
In addition to the plus velocity, Ryan has two plus-flashing breaking balls in an upper-80s cutter/slider that he commands to his glove side and an 80-85 mph curveball with late vertical bite. Ideally Ryan will be able to refine his changeup over time. He's using it less than 10% of the time right now and its results aren't great, but he's a great athlete who is relatively new to pitching, so we're projecting on that offering. His curveball has enough depth to act as his go-to bat-missing weapon against lefties until his changeup improves. 
The visual report here is pretty ironclad. Ryan's build is a little bit more slight than the prototypical big league starter, but at 6-foot-2, he isn't small. He has sustained premium velocity over 100 innings of work, his breaking balls are plus to the eye and grade out as plus on paper, and his command is sufficient for Ryan to start and might continue to improve as he gets experience pitching. This is one of the better all-around pitching prospects in baseball, a pretty likely mid-rotation starter who might have significant skill development in his later 20s. It's plausible Ryan could be one of the best five starters in the org at some point in 2024 and make his way into the rotation, but there are currently so many suitable options already on the 40-man roster ahead of him that's it's more likely he gets his footing in the big leagues in 2025.",,"29514"

He spent most of the year at Double-A New Hampshire (with some rehab outings sprinkled in) before a Fall League stint that boosted his season-long innings total to 62. He’s yet to truly test his mettle as a professional starter, with the 78.2 innings he threw in 2022 representing his high-water mark thus far. While he's still on track for an impact starter role, there's an industry-wide desire to see Tiedemann prove he can hold his excellent stuff for 120 or so frames.  
When he has been healthy, however, Tiedemann’s stuff has indeed been excellent. He relies heavily on a wicked, mid-to-high-90s four-seamer thrown from a deceptively low lefty arm slot that keeps hitters in either batter's box uncomfortable. He primarily pairs it with a sweeper that has a boatload of horizontal movement, so much in fact that at times it's easy for hitters to lay off of it. This is a great strike-getting weapon because it starts in the lefty batter's box and finishes on the arm-side corner of the plate. Tiedemann's changeup is also pretty good, though more because his command of it has progressed; on pure stuff, it's only fair. You can get a detailed look at his delivery and pitches via the linked video. He already has two plus pitches and one that pretty comfortably projects to be above average, and with them Tiedemann posted a strikeout rate above 44% and a 1.68 FIP while holding opposing hitters to a batting average below .200 in 2023. 
Aspects of Tiedemann's delivery are unique in a way that makes him look reliever-y, but even if he ends up in the bullpen, he's going to be such a dominant reliever that he'll still belong about this high on a prospect list. He doesn't have to be put on the Blue Jays' 40-man until after the 2025 season, but especially if they feel like he can help them contend in 2024, it's possible Tiedemann kicks down the door and cuts his teeth at the big league level as a long reliever before transitioning back into the rotation down the line.","gi5o5UEm10g","sa3018096"

Alcántara is already very dangerous to the opposite field, he has plus measureable power before the age of 22, and he's going to get stronger. His lanky build has plenty of room for added muscle, and the fact that he’s already been a 20-homer pace guy in the minors and still has room on his frame for another 20 pounds or so suggests he might have elite power at peak. Built like Jerami Grant, Alcántara's long limbs provide him with big natural power, but also sometimes make his swing hard to time correctly. He is so long-limbed that he'll likely always have swing-and-miss issues (they may get worse as he faces big league fastballs), and the fact that he's chase-prone doesn't help. He’s inconsistent in games, sometimes looking like a stud and other times looking somewhat uncoordinated and out of sync with his body. That's a pretty common problem for young hitters built like this. Center fielders whose contact profiles resemble Alcántara's include Jose Siri, Michael A. Taylor, James Outman, and Jazz Chisholm Jr., guys whose performance tends to vary a lot year-to-year, and the same will likely be true of Alcántara. 
The thing that stabilizes Alcántara's profile is his center field defense, which has become quite good. He's a plus runner with plus range and ball skills, and a fearlessness around the warning track. He's gotten very good at the minutiae of the position, like running to a spot and positioning himself to throw before he's collected the baseball. The 2024 season is Alcántara's second option year, and he's the sort of player who tends to peak deeper into his 20s and isn't a lock to hit the ground running versus big league pitching next year. With Pete Crow-Armstrong and Cody Bellinger entrenched ahead of him, it's possible that roster pressure puts him in the crosshairs of a trade.","2sIOce13Y4M","25971"

What would have been Rodriguez's first pro season was squashed by the pandemic and his next two were shortened by knee and abdominal injuries, limiting him to just 84 combined games in his first three years as a pro. He posted huge stats in those small samples and then sustained it across a full season, with an .863 OPS at High-A Cedar Rapids in 2023. Rodriguez is off to an even better start at Wichita in 2024, and while that's a hitter-friendly environ, his underlying TrackMan data corroborates it (more on that in a second). 
The thing that is going to pop off the screen at you when Rodriguez reaches Minnesota is his defense. He isn't an elite speedster with huge range; instead, he has incredible skill at the catch point. He makes spectacular plays around the wall and while going to the ground. His reads, routes, instincts and ball skills in center are all spectacular, and right now, he has the foot speed to play there. ""Right now"" is key, however, and this is where Rodriguez's profile takes a bit of a turn and becomes difficult to wrangle. Rodriguez is a stocky 5-foot-11, 215 pounds or so already at age 21. He glides around the outfield with ease at present, but whether that will still be true even three or five years down the line isn't certain because his body is already maxed out. This might be the kind of player who ends up being an elite corner outfield defender rather than a center fielder. 
Back to Rodriguez's offense, which is comprised of extremes. He's running a 25% walk rate and has more walks than hits as of this update. This is one of the dozen or so most patient hitters in pro baseball; Rodriguez's swing rate has hovered around 33% in 2024, with his chase rate near 10%. He is also producing big power on contact and does so in a modest mechanical distance because he's a shorter-levered guy. His hard-hit rate and the average of the hardest 10% of his balls in play are in Kyle Schwarber territory (their swings aren't similar, their the data is). Rodriguez is dangerous to all fields versus pitches in the bottom two thirds of the strike zone, but he has a huge hole in his swing at the top of the zone that threatens to hinder every element of his offense. There are plenty of power hitters who make as little contact as Rodriguez does when he swings, but his issue might be more readily exploited by opposing pitchers and could be a body blow to the way his plate skills actually play. Rodriguez is probably going to hit under .200 some seasons but still get to power and walk a bunch. Very similar to Trent Grisham, except with more juice and probably an eventual sunset on his center field defense, Rodriguez is likely to be the Twins' everyday center fielder relatively soon.","-XltguAldkY","sa3014693"

He's been a Top 100 guy at the site for each of the last couple of years because of his monster stuff but has been relegated to the back of the list due to concerns around his health, which were relevant as recently as last season, when Miller was shelved for most of the year with a UCL sprain. He was shifted to the bullpen upon his return and has been maybe the nastiest reliever in baseball so far this season, but that health history is an inextricable part of his profile, and it wasn't so long ago that he and Daniel Espino were birds of a feather in this regard. Miller has somehow had a velo spike and is averaging 100 mph with his fastball early in 2024. He's has pared down his repertoire (cutter scrapped, changeup de-emphasized) and is now almost exclusively a fastball/slider guy. Miller's slider has crazy vertical depth for an 89 mph pitch.

Throughout the season, his velocity not only climbed back into the 94-97 range that he had shown during the fall of 2021, but blew right past it, and Misiorowski was often up to 100 leading up to the draft. He sat in the upper 90s and touched 100 several times during the MLB Draft Combine, while also flashing a plus slider with huge length. He was ranked 24th on the FanGraphs draft board but fell all the way to pick 63. By the time he was pitching at 2022 instructs, Misiorowski had already added a second breaking ball to his repertoire and looked incredibly nasty, though whether he'd find the plate in any given outing was highly variable. That continued in a caricatured way in 2023, as Miz accrued 20 starts across three levels, totaled 71.1 IP, struck out 35% of opposing hitters, and saw his walk rate climb at each stop, culminating in a gnarly 15% BB% at Double-A Biloxi. 
Misiorowski's fastball averaged 97 mph in 2023 and touched 102. It was one thing to see him do that three innings at a time coming off prolonged rest during 2022 instructs, and another to watch him do it across 70 innings. He gets way down the mound and creates tough angle on his fastball at the top of the zone. His breaking balls also have elite quantifiable movement. His curveball bends in around the 82-85 mph range with gigantic lateral wipe, while his slider is more likely to be 84-87 mph. So many of Miz's breakers are nowhere near the zone, and they generated a slightly below-average chase rate for a slider because hitters weren't biting. 
Misiorowski still hasn't totally grown into his long-limbed body and has way below-average release consistency and command. Lots of scouts and clubs were very fearful he was a relief-only prospect before he was drafted and that's still the case. You can't walk as many hitters as Misiorowski has and be a reliable big leaguer, let alone a star, but as a JUCO prospect with just one year of pro instruction so far, there is huge developmental projection here, as well as the physical characteristics you're looking for in an impact arm. The power and balance of his lower half is remarkable and at a loose 6-foot-7, Miz has the frame to withstand a starter's workload as he adds strength. Obviously we're projecting substantially on Misiorowski's ability to command the baseball for him to grade out this highly. His ceiling as a reliever is big enough that this ranking might be correct even if he never throws enough strikes to start.","eL000Q5EAxA","sa3020644"

Over the course of the 10 starts he did make, he allowed just four earned runs (all in the same game) and handily outmatched his Low-A opponents, who put a mere 13 balls in play while posting a measly .148/.179/.148 line. He pulled this off thanks to a mid-90s fastball and a devastating 79-82 mph horizontal slider that consistently sent confused bats a-flailing. The fastball/slider combo was more than enough to make Schultz stand out in 2023, and if he can improve on the consistency of his changeup, which currently flashes above average and saw an uptick in usage toward the end of the season, he could unlock a more robust arsenal and add to the impact of his slider. 
His height, build, arm slot, and slider quality (seriously) have inspired inevitable comparisons to famed photographer Randy Johnson, though it’s far too early to hang such expectations on a 20-year-old with just 27 professional innings. His slider <em>is</em> that nutty, though. Schultz has filled out physically since being drafted, which is promising in terms of his durability and arm strength, but his season nevertheless came to an abrupt end when he went on the IL with a left shoulder impingement in mid-August. We want to see Schultz demonstrate starter durability before absolutely stuffing him on our overall prospect list, but he has the talent to be one of the top couple of pitching prospects in the sport if he can sit 94-95 like this across 120-plus innings.","hb_PKzm1MTQ","sa3020949"

After he destroyed High-A for just 20 games at the end of 2022, the Brewers sent Quero straight to Double-A in 2023, and he responded by slashing .262/.339/.440 and upping his previously concerning walk rate to 10%. He also more than doubled his previous career home run total by swatting 16 of them, though Biloxi and many Southern League ballparks tend to inflate homers. 
Quero gets right on top of the plate and is looking to pull the ball in the air as much as possible. He is best at snatching fastballs up around his hands and lining them down the left field line, which is how he does most of his extra-base damage. This approach can leave him vulnerable to stuff on the outer edge, which he sometimes struggles to even reach, but so far it was worked for Quero, who has never struck out more than 19% of the time at any minor league level. Quero's 85% in-zone contact rate would be top 10 among big league catchers, but his overall contact rate is more toward the middle of that position group because, despite his uptick in walks, Quero is still pretty chase-prone. His swing rates (56-57% the last two years) are way up there with the Mario Felicianos, Francisco Mejías and Jorge Alfaros of the world, predecessors whose monster tools have been severely undercut by their voracious approaches. Yainer Diaz had a rock solid 2022 debut with similar rate stats, and Quero is a better defender than Mejía (identical rate contact stats), so we can project him north of Mejía's outcome pretty comfortably. 
Quero can get caught in between whether he wants to block or backhand pitches in the dirt to his right, but otherwise he's a good defensive catcher, especially for a 21-year-old. He has a plus arm and routinely pops below 1.9 seconds, and his receiving and pitch framing are much better than most college-aged catchers. He's now on Milwaukee's 40-man and is a good enough defender that they should feel comfortable with him getting big league time in 2024 if anything happens to William Contreras or Gary Sánchez. Long-term, he projects as a primary catcher, though Contreras' emergence might complicate things.","Q5KxKyggNws","sa3015407"

With so many other infielders also in the upper-level mix for playing time, chiefly Gunnar Henderson and Jackson Holliday, the Orioles traded Ortiz as part of a package for Corbin Burnes. His profile was initially rooted in his plus combination of defense and feel for contact, but in 2023, he traded some of that contact for meaningfully more power. Ortiz’s underlying contact quality took a leap across the board, most notably his hard-hit rate, which rose from 31% in 2022 to 46% in 2023. This was coupled with a noticeable shift in his physicality, as Ortiz looked bigger and stronger. Ortiz’s contact rates, both overall and in-zone, dropped a tad compared to 2022 and he’s a bit chase-prone, but his well-rounded offensive output should clear the relatively low bar for middle infielders. 
While a capable shortstop, Ortiz is not quite the defender that Willy Adames is. Unless Adames is also traded, Ortiz is more likely to wind up playing second base, where he is an exceptional, Gold Glove-caliber defender. His range and acrobatics are rare for that position. If not for Rhys Hoskins’ presence at first base, Milwaukee’s current projected group of Adames, Ortiz, and Brice Turang would be one of the best infield defenses in baseball. Ortiz projects as an everyday middle infielder at either position and is talented enough to be a part of Milwaukee’s core for the next half decade.","oLEMiIO78pw","25493"

It also acknowledged that some of Marcelo's late 2023 dip could have been caused by the effects of a shoulder injury (which he tried playing through before it ultimately ended his season), and that a 21-year-old could pretty quickly remake his body and once again have the requisite athleticism to handle shortstop. Some of that has turned out to be true, and Mayer has raked at Double-A Portland during the first half of 2024, but I still think there are some underlying issues here. Clearly he's graded as a 50 FV player and therefore projects to be an everyday shortstop, but I think these warts will stifle his production below the superstar level readers might expected of him.
The way Mayer's swing works (his front side is very upright through contact, his hips tend to bail toward first base pretty early, and his bat path struggles to find pitches down and away from him) continues to leave him vulnerable against soft stuff. His issues haven't been as stark in 2024 as they were in 2023 when he had a sub-.500 OPS against secondary pitches, but there's still an enormous dip compared to the way he handles fastballs. Choirs of angels have blessed Mayer's hitting hands, which are deft and drive contact explosive enough to remain excited about his overall offensive future, just not to the level of a Bobby Witt Jr. or Corey Seager in terms of impact. If we suddenly see more bend in his lower body, the way Max Muncy altered his swing before his huge breakout in LA, then there will be reason to re-evaluate. 
Mayer has always been a bit boxier than the usual elite shortstop prospect, but his hands and actions are so skillful and polished that he seemed likely to play there despite middling range. Perhaps because his mobility was compromised from the general discomfort of his shoulder issue, Mayer's range backed up in 2023 and his arm accuracy was sometimes poor. He definitely looks trimmer in 2024 and the Red Sox appear to be positioning him closer to the hole so he can make more plays moving right to left. It isn't sexy, but it works. Mayer's footwork and actions are still very polished and the Red Sox have found a way to mask his mediocre range and arm strength (for shortstop). Things feel much more stable here than they did at the end of 2023. Hopefully Mayer will keep hitting Eastern League pitching and merit a promotion so we can watch him face and adjust to junkballing Triple-A veterans who might force him to make relevant adjustments. He's tracking like a late 2025 or early 2026 debut.",,"sa3017114"

He has sublime feel for contact and can really run, presenting the Tigers with an old school leadoff hitter's profile as he enters pro ball. 
With barrel control well beyond his years, Clark has rare hit tool projection for a high school prospect, spraying flush, all-fields contact with remarkable consistency. Though his swing doesn't feature big lift and Clark lacks overt, frame-based power projection, the amount of contact he makes and its quality should enable him to hit for plenty of in-game power in pro ball — it will just likely manifest as 40 or 50 doubles rather than 30-plus home runs. 
Clark has Corbin Carroll's high school skill set with something closer to a prototypical major league build and more present physicality than Carroll had at the same stage. It's not as though Clark is put together like high school Manny Machado or Ken Griffey Jr., but he's sinewy and strong, especially in his lower half. While some weight room warriors (like Spencer Torkelson and Jarred Kelenic) may have gotten so muscular and stiff that they began to have problems dipping to contact pitches low in the strike zone, Clark's natural barrel feel should help mitigate this. He has special hit tool projection and speed, the latter of which should help enable him to stay in center field even though his feel for the position is only fair. Clark projects as an everyday center fielder whose pathway to superstardom is dependent on him either developing more home run power than I expect, or having elite plate discipline and on-base ability. He chased so infrequently after the draft that I believe the latter scenario stands a better chance of happening.","yt4_ilKyXhE","sa3022683"

But his post-draft foray into pro ball featured its fair share of awkward swings and a sudden inability to pull the baseball, and it looked like Johnson would need more polish and development than was hoped. He missed the first month of 2023 with a hamstring injury and struggled very badly with strikeouts upon his initial return, but he cut his Ks down to 20% after the All-Star break and hit .260/.451/.487 the rest of the season with no signs of slowing down even after a promotion to Greensboro. Not only did Johnson right the ship on paper, but he <em>looked</em> great. His body has become leaner and stronger since high school, and he was swinging with the ferocity that made him an exciting draft prospect. 
So far in 2024, Johnson's look has been more mixed. Even though his strikeout rates aren't out of control, his underlying contact data is pretty concerning, with a sub-70% contact rate and sub-80% z-contact% as of list publication. He's still swinging hard and has supreme control of the strike zone, but he's struggling badly to cover the outer third of the plate. 
Johnson is also struggling on defense. A high school shortstop who probably could have played there had he gone to Arizona State, Johnson was projected to second base in pro ball but still needs to improve if he's going to stay on the infield. He's playing with a high center of gravity and has shown poor hands of late. Johnson looks like he's going to be a slower developmental burn than was hoped when he was drafted, but he still has rare lefty power and elite plate discipline (a miniscule 20% chase rate regardless of the count). The bust risk and variance associated with Johnson's profile has definitely been elevated since he turned pro, but we're betting on his bat speed and lauded personhood to carry him to an everyday role at the keystone.","jQuL4t_v8Lw","sa3020214"

There are international scouting personnel whose club reports on De Vries said ""everything is at least plus"" and think he's a no-doubt shortstop with a 60- or 70-grade arm and a projectable frame; one executive considered him the best international prospect in more than a half decade. Same as they have with their recent high-profile prospects, the Padres wasted no time in pushing De Vries' promotion pace. Most prospects who sign in a given year spend all of the rest of it in the Dominican getting their feet wet in pro ball. De Vries was on the Peoria complex weeks after he signed, competed with guys who had pro experience during a little bit of extended spring training, and then was sent out to Lake Elsinore at the end of April. He turns 18 in October. 
De Vries is doing fine at Elsinore, though not great unless you account for his age. He has a slightly above-league average line as of list publication and the pace of the game has been a little too much for him on the defensive side. De Vries does have one hell of an arm, but his footspeed (he's running 4.4 from the left side on tape) isn't that of a typical shortstop, and pro scouts have tended to project him to second base. I think it's a little too early for that. De Vries is definitely bigger and stronger now than when he was an amateur and it does seem to have slowed him down, but he's plenty young enough to change course. He's a skill-based fit at short (not the best bender, though) with plenty of arm, and his range is a thing to monitor. 
On offense, De Vries can bang from both sides of the plate. He has remarkably consistent feel for elevation in basically every part of the strike zone and enough power to be dangerous already at age 17. De Vries' righty swing is fairly grooved, but he's hit most of his homers from that batter's box so far and he's going to damage mistakes that run into his bat path from that side. De Vries hit exclusively left-handed for a stretch in late May but has been back to switch-hitting since then. His lefty swing is more dynamic than the righty one, but his hands are really noisy before they fire, and he's late to the contact point frequently enough to do a good bit of whiffing as a lefty right now. Again, he's 17. This is a very talented young fella with the potential to be an impact middle infielder. The range of outcomes is pretty big: He could be an Ozzie Albies type of power-hitting second baseman, he could be a pre-tweak Anthony Volpe. Most of the outcomes are good so long as De Vries fine-tunes aspects of his game the way most teenage hitters have to.",,"sa3023363"

Scott began the 2023 season on the IL with an oblique strain, but once he was healthy, he was on the expressway to Queens, climbing three levels across just 19 starts en route to a spot on the offseason Top 100. He debuted in the bigs not long before list publication.  
Scott has a huge wingspan and gets way down the mound, traits that combine to give him huge extension and a shallow approach angle. His fastball really jumps on hitters, and he misses a ton of bats with it at the top of the zone even though it's technically a sinker. He's always had a pretty juicy slider, and he and the Mets have done well to demarcate his two breaking balls; Scott now has an upper-80s cutter and a slightly slower sweeper-style slider. Not only does he have two distinct breakers, but last year Scott seemed to have altered his changeup into a firmer split (its average velo increased by about five ticks, often 84-88 mph), giving him a very complete mix. Some of what Scott is doing mechanically is pretty violent (he has a nasty head whack), and you can see why he was 'penned in the past, but he's thrown a ton of strikes in pro ball (this is definitely a control over command guy) and has mostly proven he can sustain an impact fastball across a starter's load of innings. From a craftsmanship standpoint, Scott is remarkably advanced for a guy who didn't start in college. I had him projected for a 2025 debut during the offseason because of his 40-man timeline, but the Mets thought he was ready for prime time already. He projects as a mid-rotation starter.",,"30107"

Knee and hamstring surgery effectively knocked him out for the 2020 season, but Lee raked in his sophomore and junior years with a great Cape Cod stint sandwiched in between. Before the 2022 draft there was again industry buzz that some teams were off him because of his medical, and he fell deeper into the draft than is typical for a college shortstop with his statistical track record. Minnesota sent Lee to High-A almost immediately and he raked. He had a very solid first three months of 2023 at Double-A Wichita before his performance and visual scouting look fell off late in the year at Triple-A St. Paul.

Because of his size (Brad Miller is a fair body comp), straight line speed (he's heavy-footed from home to first, in the 4.5s) and his medical, clubs have tended to project him to third base, and Lee began to see time there about once a week after he was promoted to St. Paul. He began the 2024 season on the IL with a herniated disc that kept him out until the end of May. 
Lee is still mostly playing shortstop, and our projection has always been a little more bullish about him staying there, at least for a while, largely based on Lee's great feel for the position. He has quick actions and is adept at positioning his body to be ready to throw as he fields the baseball, his transfer is quick, and his internal clock is well-calibrated. He finds creative ways to make timely, accurate throws, and even though it sometimes looks awkward and like he is making the play harder than it needs to be, Lee makes a lot of fun, flashy plays for a bigger dude with mediocre range. We're less certain about his shortstop projection now than we were a year ago, though, because he looked less mobile later in 2023 and has now had a disc issue that hearkens back (ahem) to his pre-draft medical concerns. 
Lee's explosion in the batter's box has also dialed down a bit. He's still swinging hard from the left side, but elements of his cut have been tardy upon his return from the IL, and his righty swing is far less explosive. This could be due more to time off from hitting than physical malady; it's something to watch as his 2024 drags on. Carlos Correa's resurgence makes it less imperative for Lee to be ready as soon as possible. It may be more important for opposing teams to evaluate him as a trade target. The same injury-related considerations that have us approaching Lee's prospect grade and everyday player forecast with a light touch might also be reason for teams to be apprehensive about making him the centerpiece of a deal.",,"31595"

Teams mostly understood his commitment to ASU to be pretty loose, and Keith signed for an over-slot $500,000 as a fifth rounder in the 2020 draft. Injuries limited him during his first two full seasons in the Tigers org, but he mashed when he played. He looked great during the 2022 Arizona Fall League, then clubbed nearly 70 extra-base hits in 126 games throughout a fully healthy 2023 split between Double- and Triple-A. During his stay in Toledo, Keith began to see more time at second base rather than his native third. He's a bad defender at both spots but has a much greater chance at becoming passable (read: hidden) at second, where some of Keith's issues with throwing are masked. 
Keith's offensive prowess is rooted in his raw power. He nearly killed managing editor Meg Rowley and her laptop in the auxiliary press box during his Futures Game BP when two or three of his dingers clanged off the face of the deck above her. Keith clocks fastballs well and is short to the top of the strike zone. He struggles with soft stuff in the bottom third of the zone, especially changeups, which he tends to swing over the top of. This will likely prevent Keith from being a plus contact hitter, but I don't view him as being so risky in this regard that it threatens his whole profile. He's a flawed player and his WAR output will be impacted by his lack of position, but Keith is going to slug enough to profile as either a DH or bad-gloved second baseman.
Keith has bulked up considerably since signing, and the effects of his increased size are evident on defense. Once a fair bet to stay on the middle infield, he is now fighting just to stay at third. He is stiff and bulky, his actions are well below average, and while he shows you a big arm when he gets to wind up and really let it eat, he struggles to throw from odd platforms. It's feasible a team could live with him playing third base situationally, but it's not ideal, and Colt is a 30-grade defender right now. He is similar to Nolan Gorman in the way he has trended athletically on defense, but there's enough bat to support an everyday fit at the bottom of the defensive spectrum. Despite the underwhelming defensive forecast, Detroit clearly likes what they have in Keith: In January, the Tigers signed him to a six-year, $28.6 million extension with three club options and incentives that could push it's value to $82 million.","XpRBXuPDNN8","27899"

He still has some warts, which I'll talk about in a second, but his overall offensive ability should provide enough impact for him to break the profound University of Arizona hitter drought the game has experienced since Scott Kingery's swoon. 
Wells' swing is beautifully connected from the ground up. The blend of his barrel control and the natural lift in his swing gives him a potent contact and power combination, which will likely make him a valuable hitter even if he ends up being unable to catch. His peak exit velos weren't incredible in 2023, but Wells was working back from a rib injury that may have sapped his explosiveness. In the past, I've been concerned about his inability to make contact with fastballs running up and away from him, but he wasn't as helpless against them when you put on his tape from late in 2023 tape. Anyone with a swing as uphill as Wells' is going to swing underneath a lot of fastballs in that location, but he snatches his fair share of them and is dangerous enough in this part of the zone to alleviate some of my past apprehension. More of a problem during his big league stint toward the end of 2023 was Wells' tendency to chase and swing over the top of changeups. Wells was a steady 11% (or better) walk rate guy in the minors, but he seemed to be pressing during his cup of coffee. I'm inclined to bet that his true skill level is closer to his historical norms. 
Even an average hit/power combination would be a big deal if Wells can remain a catcher. Ever since a severe shoulder injury he suffered in high school, Wells has had issues throwing out runners. Runners have had a 82% success rate against him in pro ball (343 total stolen bases in 308 pro games). His pop times are fine (1.90 during his big league trial per Baseball Savant), but his footwork is inconsistent as he leaves his crouch, causing inaccurate throws. This issue needs long-term attention, but Wells has made considerable progress as a receiver and ball-blocker despite his below-average hands and limited lateral mobility, the result of his one-knee style. I'm now more bullish than I've ever been about him staying behind the dish. It looks like the Yankees might carry three catchers on their big league roster, which would give them the flexibility to catch Wells when the starting pitcher is good at holding runners and give him some run in left field on other days (he played left a little bit in college). This is a great way to get Wells' feet wet as a big league defender while also getting his bat into the lineup regularly, but ideally he'll improve enough as a thrower to simply be the primary catcher for the better part of the next half decade.","nze40aRSOeo","27562"

Jung seemed gassed after the draft and hit just one homer in 30 games, but his power output exploded in 2023; he clubbed 28 homers, half of them in just 47 Double-A contests during the last month and a half of the season. After 128 regular season games, Jung was sent to the Arizona Fall League, where he played third base. Since his sophomore year of college he had only played second base, and while he's a capable pivot man on double plays, Jung is otherwise a below-average keystone defender. Some of what Jung struggled with at second base will follow him to third, but his lack of footspeed will be less of an issue, and Jung's arm looked suited for the left side of the infield during his Fall League trial. Ideally Jung can be capable enough to shuttle back and forth between both spots. 
Jung is dangerous all over the zone. He can crush pitches on the outer third into the oppo gap, and he'll hit some epic pull-side homers. His swing has big, aggressive launch and he has enough feel for the barrel to weaponize it, though his style of hitting does cause him to whiff quite a bit in the strike zone. He does skilled, hitterish things in order to slug, but because of his style, Jung is likely to make below-average rates of contact. Ryan McMahon, or perhaps the last few years of Max Muncy (without such good plate discipline), is a good barometer for what to expect from Jung: a below-average infield athlete who trades a little bit of contact to get to huge power. Jung is talented enough to win a job at some point fairly early in 2024. The newly extended Colt Keith is a second base-only fit if he's going to play the infield at all, which would force Jung to third. Though flawed, Jung should slug enough to produce like a 2-ish WAR player annually and be a core build-around guy in Detroit.",,"31437"

Tightly wound and muscular, Ford looks incredible during BP but has crude feel for contact in games. He's kept his strikeout rates to a manageable level even though he has an obvious hole in his swing at the top of the strike zone, in part because he's a very discerning hitter with great plate discipline. As explosive as Ford's hands are, they tend to load and fire late. This is an individual whose K rates I expect will be very high when facing big league pitching every day. Still, on-base skills and mistake power tend to be plenty at catcher. 
When Ford was drafted, he needed a lot technical development behind the plate. Indeed, he was so raw that there was talk of him being drafted as a center fielder. He has tweaked some aspects of his defense and is now catching on one knee. His pitch framing is still too conspicuous, but it's much better than when he was drafted, as is Ford's ball-blocking, which remains the weakest aspect of his defense. His arm is incredible — you don't need a stopwatch to know Ford has an absolute hose, just watching this guy throw the baseball leaves no doubt. Ford is flawed but the skills he does have are top shelf in quality, and they're a rarity at the position he plays. It would not surprise me if Ford hits under .200 a couple of times throughout his career, but he's going to do enough other stuff to be a good primary catcher anyway.",,"sa3017627"

I've been of the mind that his elite center field defense would cause the Red Sox to deploy him out there regularly, but he looks quite good at short and the org has a much clearer need there than in the outfield, so perhaps we'll see him do a mix of both for the long haul. His acrobatics are apparent at both positions, but especially in center, where Rafaela would be an all-world defender. Most super skinny SS/CF prospects wind up in the outfield due to a lack of arm strength, but Rafaela has improved enough in this area to feel more comfortable with him at shortstop regularly. 
Even at 23, Rafaela still has a sinewy, projectable frame. He's hit 20-21 bombs each of the last two seasons in the minors and is on pace to hit 15 in the big leagues this year, though you're seeing his complete lack of plate discipline rear its ugly head in the majors as he walks at a paltry 3% clip.

For starters, Ramos is an astounding low-to-the-ground athlete whose powerful legs facilitate spectacular feats on offense and defense. He has plus range and is capable of making strong throws from all kinds of awkward body positions. The White Sox have tried Ramos some at second base, but we think the ceiling on his third base defense is big enough that they should just let him play there. For whatever reason, Ramos airmails routine throws more than is typical of a big league third baseman, or he at least misses enough to pull the first baseman off the bag and make things more interesting than they need to be. He has the physical ability to be a plus or better defender, but we'll stop short of projecting him as such as long as this issue is present. 
Similarly, Ramos has one specific offensive flaw that will require adjustment to remedy. His hands load late (there's a little wrap, and he's still separating while the pitch is in flight), and he is too long back into the zone to compete with fastballs around his hands. He's easily at his best when he's fully extended on pitches away from him. We love how loose and explosive Ramos' hitting hands are through contact, though. His best swings are some of the prettiest righty cuts of any prospect in baseball, and Ramos is capable of doing huge all-fields damage because of his strength and bat speed. He's also a discerning hitter. While a groin injury shelved him for the first month and a half of the 2023 regular season, thus limiting his data sample somewhat, Ramos barely chases and has especially steely nerves with two strikes. Many hitters have higher chase rates with two strikes than their all-count chase, but Ramos' holds steady at an excellent 26%. There are going to be some pitchers whose fastballs live in Ramos' Forbidden Zone, and they'll be able to get him out at will if they can execute around his hands (barring an adjustment), but otherwise Ramos projects as a dangerous and exciting young position player the White Sox can build around.","mR7nu6u00Tk","25621"

So far in pro ball, Gilbert is performing more like a do-everything player with a balanced hit/power skill set and just enough center field defense to project there in the big leagues. He reached Double-A with Houston during the first half of 2023, then was traded to New York as part of the Justin Verlander deal and slashed a fantastic .325/.423/.561 during his post-trade time with Binghamton. He was assigned to Triple-A Syracuse at the start of the 2024 season but suffered a hamstring injury in early April. Anthony DiComo went into detail on the status Gilbert's rehab for MLB.com, indicating a late May or early June timetable. 
Gilbert has gotten stronger since signing (he was already yoked) and takes a mighty rip for a 5-foot-9 guy. He is a very dangerous low-ball hitter, capable of tracking and adjusting to breaking balls mid-flight. When Gilbert collapses his back side and leans on one, he'll show you emphatic pull-side lift, and he does most of his extra-base damage by yanking doubles down the right field line. While Gilbert shows some other hitterish characteristics with the occasional oppo liner, he is less of a bat control master than he is a twitchy, short-levered hitter who is tough to beat because of how concise his swing is. His barrel is in the zone for a long time and he tends to find a way to put the ball in play, using his strength to muscle balls past infielders. He made what is roughly an average rate of contact for a starting big league center fielder in 2023, but he also hit the ball harder than expected. It'd be surprising if Gilbert hit 25-plus annual bombs, as pitchers can stay away from him and limit his power, but he's going to ambush 18 or so and hit a ton of doubles, which is great for a capable center fielder.
A plus runner, Gilbert can go get it in center field and has a great arm. His range is fine, but his hands and ball skills aren't the best, and there are some scouts who think he'll be plus in a corner rather than stick in center. Gilbert plays with an edge, the kind of guy you love to have on your team but hate to play against, with his on-field persona toeing the line between ""fiery"" and ""excessively abrasive."" He's a spicy heel with the ability to be a well-rounded regular and he's on pace to debut ahead of his stock 40-man timeline.",,"sa3019980"

That's what you're tasked with as you line him up on the universal prospect continuum after his 80-game suspension, which will cost him the first half of 2024. Marte's eval and forecast has already waxed and waned some, often in lockstep with his conditioning. At times he has looked heavy and haggard, though sometimes fatigue has been a reasonable explanation for this. In 2022, he played some January winter ball for Gigantes del Cibao, saw 520 regular season plate appearances in the States, changed organizations as the highest-profile prospect in the blockbuster Luis Castillo deadline deal, went to Germany as part of Team Spain's WBC qualifier roster, and then came back to the US and played for another six weeks in the Arizona Fall League, where he looked pretty awful. He seemed rejuvenated in 2023 and slashed .279/.358/.454 split between Double- and Triple-A before debuting in Cincinnati to the tune of a .316/.366/.456 line in 123 major league PA. Marte continued to look svelte in the D.R. over the winter before he was shut down with a pulled hammy. The news of his PED suspension was the first in a slew of tough breaks for the Reds offense. 
Without the PED suspension clouding his report, Marte projects as an everyday third baseman with a shot to be a more impactful player if he finds a way to get to his power more consistently. He's has good plate coverage, only really whiffing a bunch against well-executed sliders, which is true of most hitters. He tends to cut down on the baseball and can really only elevate hanging breaking balls and pitches toward the top of the strike zone. Some of this is caused by Noelvi's swing path and some of it is caused by imprecise feel for sweet spot contact; Marte hits a lot of choppers and grounders even though he doesn't whiff all that much. To the eye, he is not as skilled a hitter as he has been on paper, and while he's incredibly physical and has above-average raw power already at age 22, Marte's swing is not actualized to get to all of it. While you can pick enough nits to stop short of calling Noelvi a future superstar, he's still a well-rounded player who has more recently looked as engaged and agile on defense as ever. Though the track record of past prospects suspended for PEDs isn't great, Marte's slide here is due more to lost time than any false sense of precision around the way PEDs may have buffed his tools. He slides behind Rhett Lowder on the Reds list and down next to Jasson Domínguez (who is also missing about half the season recovering from TJ) on the Top 100.","CEY7xdrO7zA","26517"

In a bodily sense, he was also unlike any amateur prospect most scouts had ever seen. Built at age 16 like a late-20s Mike Trout, nobody was totally sure how Domínguez's body and physicality would develop as he entered his 20s, and this (plus the internet hype) was what made him similar to Zion. Domínguez's pro career got off to a delayed start because of the pandemic, which clouded the outlook for his hit tool even more than is typical for a risky amateur prospect like this. After some initial struggles in 2021, especially from a contact standpoint, Domínguez quickly climbed through the minors and reached the big leagues late in 2023 as a 20-year-old. He showed his trademark power during an eight-game stint before his UCL blew out. He had Tommy John late in September and is slated to miss nine or 10 months, which puts him on pace to return in June or July of 2024. 
Domínguez's impact power is the tool that floats his prospect boat. He has incredible strength and bat speed for a hitter his age, and he's forecast here to slug enough to make up for other ills. Domínguez is not yet an especially comfortable or smooth outfield defender, and he doesn't have great feel for the barrel from either side of the plate. Which of Domínguez's skills should we continue to project on? I don't want to project on his power as much as I normally might for a 20-year-old because his frame is already maxed out. In fact, Domínguez's bulkiness makes me want to project a near-term regression in foot speed. If Domínguez is going to be an impact player, then his feel for either center field or for contact needs to improve. I think the former is more likely, considering how few reps he's had there in pro ball. It will be important for Domínguez to stay as lithe and fast as possible during his TJ rehab to give him a better chance of remaining at a premium position, where his rather extreme power-over-hit skill set has the best chance to profile.","x6cbWcITk7Q","28080"

He then dominated A-ball in his first full pro season before looking overmatched during a late 2023 and early 2024 cup of coffee at Double-A Binghamton. He was shut down with wrist soreness in late April and hasn't played since. MLB.com's Anthony DiComo had a status update on Williams a couple of weeks ago, indicating he may be good to go by the end of May. Williams posted walk rates near 20% at Low- and High-A; over 115 combined games, he hit 13 homers and stole 44 bases, forcing his way to the upper levels while still just 19 years old. A plus athlete and a 70 runner, he is a short-levered gap-to-gap hitter who has the catalytic qualities of a dangerous leadoff man. 
It's too soon to call him a do-everything, five-tool prospect, but Williams isn't far off. He has a sizable hole in his swing at the top of the strike zone, which is atypical of a compact hitter like this. But his feel for the strike zone is excellent, his hitting hands are super explosive, and Jett can adjust to breaking balls by bending in his lower half in a way that is rare even for good hitters. I do think the belt-high hole in his swing is more likely to be exposed in a meaningful way now that he's reached the upper minors, but the power and OBP combo here will still be enough for him to profile as an everyday player. 
He also has more developing to do on defense. Williams is athletically capable of playing all three up-the-middle positions but he requires polish. In 2023, he played shortstop most of the time and got a start in center field about once a week. The reliability of his hands and arm strength are both on the fringe of what's viable at short. Williams simply mishandles the baseball too much to be a good shortstop right now, and he doesn't have a ""from the hole"" cannon. He is such a rangy, high-effort athlete that I consider him a ""maybe"" long-term defender there, and the makeup report on Williams indicates he's going to work to improve in the areas he's lacking, but young prospects whose defensive scouting reports read like his at the same age (the Roman Quinns and Billy Hamiltons of the world) tend to end up in center field. Even though Williams played once a week in center, whole games would pass without him seeing any action out there. His reads and routes aren't yet comfortable, but his speed and ability to adjust when he has to flip his hips and change directions is incredible. While it might be more valuable for Williams to stay at short, I think his chances of becoming a special defender are greater if he and the Mets commit to center field. Early in 2024 they didn't seem inclined to do that; he played just one game in center before he was shut down with the wrist issue. He projects as an impact up-the-middle player even though the specifics of the defense are still cloudy.",,"sa3020134"

His athleticism (he was a two-way player at Minnesota), simple delivery, and relatively easy arm action gave teams confidence in his ability to start despite a smallish frame and inconsistent command at that time. 
Meyer passed his first professional tests with flying colors, finishing the 2021 season with a 2.41 ERA at Double-A Pensacola. His fastball velocity was down, ""only"" in the 94-97 mph range, and it has never really returned to that elite, early-2020 level. Meyer still seemed poised to make his big league debut in 2022 when he began having injury issues, first ulnar nerve irritation and then a late-summer Tommy John that cost him all of 2023. When Meyer got going at the start of 2024, his velocity was down a tad. He still managed to put together some good big league starts before he was somewhat surprisingly demoted to Jacksonville, where he's starting every Friday rather than every fifth day as a way of controlling his innings load coming off the TJ. He'd have to spend the majority of the season in the minors for the Marlins to alter his free agency timeline. With the team poised to take a seller's posture at the deadline, Meyer feels like a lock to be up at some point and pitch enough to exhaust rookie eligibility and accrue a year of service. Meyer's velocity has trended up a bit in his last couple of starts before list publication, sitting more 93-95 and touching 97 rather than living in the 92-94 mph range for much of an outing. His slider's effectiveness has been collateral damage; it's playing like a merely plus offering now. Without peak velocity, Meyer looks more like a perfectly fine fourth starter than an impact front-end arm.","k7_4XDiW_aE","27474"

He notched over 123.1 innings of work without an IL stint, which was a welcome development considering that scouts had some injury concerns surrounding college Cavalli, whose arm action is quite long and whose delivery is pretty violent. Cavalli spent 2022 at Rochester, where he wasn't as dominant as he was in 2021 but still pitched well, amassing a 3.25 FIP in just shy of 100 innings. He made his big league debut at the end of August, after which Cavalli was shut down with shoulder inflammation. While shoulder problems can derail a pitcher's career, Cavalli looked fine during his first couple of 2023 spring training outings, again sitting 96-97 mph with the same powerful mid-80s curveball he'd begun to emphasize more in 2022. He seemed poised to seize an Opening Day rotation spot, but Cavalli blew out his UCL in his third spring outing and needed Tommy John, which shelved him for all of 2023. He saw game action in the FCL for the first time since his surgery the week before list publication and his stuff appears intact. Across just over 30 pitches, Cavalli sat 95-97, touched 97.5, and actually threw more of his power 84-87 mph breaking ball than he did his fastball.
That might signal an approach change here. Cavalli's fastball plays below its velocity, but his curveball is vicious and has ridiculous depth for how hard it is. His changeup also shows bat-missing ability and when combined with the vertical curveball, gives Cavalli two weapons with which to attack lefties. Pitchers who are built like this and are this powerful and athletic tend to pan out over time, even when they have suboptimal fastball shape, with Sandy Alcantara representing the best recent example.

His overall offensive numbers sagged slightly as a Trash Panda, but certainly not in an alarming way, and his walk and strikeout rates both moved in a favorable direction. He was dealt to the White Sox as part of the Lucas Giolito trade and spent the rest of 2023 at Double-A Birmingham, where he maintained a performance slightly better than league average despite being significantly younger than the average Double-A player. He’s impressively mature at the plate, rarely expanding the zone and boasting the third-lowest swinging strike rate in all of Double-A in 2023. It’s particularly difficult to sneak one by Quero as a righty; he’s more contact-oriented from that side of the plate and has a bit more power as a lefty. Quero's swing is short and flat, which helps him make plus rates of contact. 
While his bat is the most promising part of his overall profile, he’s made improvements on defense in the past year that sweeten the pot significantly. His receiving is cleaner, and he’s shown improvements in his lateral movement and blocking. And while many of Quero's throws still one-hop second base, he has at least quickened his release enough to keep his pop times just below two seconds. Quero has rare bat-to-ball ability for a catcher and we think it will help him be Chicago's primary backstop eventually. He doesn't have to be put on the 40-man until after 2025, and it will probably be another season or two before we see him in the majors.","dLJiH3AmELA","sa3015239"

He has lovely all-fields ability to hit, snatching hanging breaking balls and inner-third fastballs to his pull side and spraying lots of middle-away fastballs to the opposite field. He's not quite as deft a hitter from the right side, but he's still plenty dangerous. Rocchio has not developed power as hoped even as he's filled out. He has shown progress in the plate discipline department and posted a career-high 11.2% walk rate in 2023, his second consecutive year with improvement in this area. Rocchio's body has gotten thick enough that he's more reliant on skills and acrobatic actions at shortstop than range. None of Cleveland's many interesting middle infield prospects of the last few years has emerged as a Dude, but Rocchio does enough to be considered a solid everyday shortstop and won the everyday job during 2024 spring training.","8RU-rUDZ2zw","23690"

As a high schooler, he was among the more polished shortstop defenders in his class and was performing well from a bat-to-ball standpoint on the showcase circuit. He looked like a high-floor middle infield prospect with a modest ceiling. Young has become much bigger and stronger in pro ball, especially in his upper body, which has aided his power but detracted somewhat from his defense. Though changes he's made to his swing have resulted in him trading some contact for power, he's still maintained strikeout rates in the mid-teens en route to a successful Double-A performance in 2024 at age 20. 
Young is a very well-rounded offensive player whose on-base skills and burgeoning power will profile at either middle infield spot. Though he sometimes struggles to cover the high-and-away portion of the zone, he otherwise has great plate coverage and a patient approach. Most of his in-game power is currently isolated to lower pitches, and he tends to inside-out a sizable portion of his contact. Young's surface-level slugging has tended to play above his current true talent level, in part because of Seattle's A-ball parks but also because of the consistent lift in Young's swing. It's a well-rounded offensive skill set more than it is a special one. 
On defense, Young is still mostly playing shortstop but is also mixing in lots of second base. His hands and exchange are good, but his arm strength and accuracy are only fair, and his future range might be a bit lacking. Considering how the Jorge Polanco trade is working out, it's becoming more likely every day that Young debuts at second base. It's probably a better fit for him long-term, especially if it allows Young to keep getting bigger and stronger on his way to generating more power in his mid-20s.",,"sa3020459"

He was a bat-first prospect on draft day whose defensive issues (ball blocking, throwing accuracy, a general lack of polish as a receiver) might have simply been due to a lack of playing time. Indeed, Rushing has begun to solve those issues while he's continued to have offensive success in pro ball. At High-A Great Lakes in his first full pro season, Rushing clubbed 15 homers, posted an 18.9% walk rate and slashed .228/.404/.452. 
Rushing hasn't suddenly become an elite receiver or pitch framer, but he's progressed enough to comfortably project as a catcher. His ball blocking still needs to improve quite a bit, as too often he tries to pick balls in the dirt with his hands rather than move his body to block them properly, and he isn't skilled enough to do it that way right now. Rushing's throwing arm has gotten much better, however. By the end of 2023, he was popping sub-1.9 seconds to second base thanks largely to the quickness of his exchange, and his throws were remarkably accurate. It's not a Gold Glove skill set, but it's enough for Rushing to more comfortably project as a catcher. 
Rushing's offense is similarly flawed but is viable for a catcher. His plate discipline is a meaningfully good skill that should enable him to run OBPs well above the average at his position. His swing is somewhat grooved (he struggles to cover stuff riding up and away from him, as well as back foot breakers), but it's geared for consistent pull-side lift and Rushing is going to hit for power when he does make contact. Rushing will likely be one of those primary catchers who hits .210 or so and still performs like an average starter because of his power and on-base skills.

I had him ranked 38th on the 2023 draft board and he was selected 22nd, but by the end of his first pro summer it was pretty clear that Emerson should have gone closer to pick 12 or so. After signing, Emerson was quickly sent to Modesto, where he slashed .302/.436/.444 for a few weeks, and he got off to a similar start there in 2024 before he suffered a small foot fracture that shelved him until the week prior to list publication. 
Emerson's lightning-fast hitting hands are lively and quick. He can let the baseball travel an extra beat before deciding to swing and either roast inside pitches to his pull side or pummel them the other way when they get deep in the zone. It's a very aesthetically pleasing swing that’s similar in form to those of several other Mariners prospects, one that looks like it might have vulnerability to belt-high fastballs, which Emerson hasn't been tested by yet. His contact rates and plate discipline have both been quantifiably plus so far in pro ball, with Emerson's 2024 swinging strike rate a very impressive 6.5% as of list publication. Emerson has below-average raw power right now. Across the board, his 2024 measurable power metrics (hard-hit rate, max exit velocity, etc) are down compared to his smaller debut sample. He's of medium build and not likely to grow into big raw, but his hit tool is going to enable Emerson to get to in-game power. 
On defense, Emerson remains a pretty inconsistent, flub-prone shortstop. He's a bendable lower-body athlete but needs to polish his hands. His arm strength, build, and level of athleticism are more typically found at second base, and he has the physical tools to be better than average there if his hands get better. Neil Walker feels like a fair comp for Emerson's high-end outcomes, but if there's more significant swing exposure down the line, a power-over-hit Rougned Odor type might be more appropriate.",,"sa3022923"

He has had a plus sweeping breaking ball in his repertoire for some time now, and the movement of that pitch is mirrored by the nasty rise and tail action on his fastball. Watching Iriarte pitch is like watching Slender Man throw 97; he is extremely loose and has premium arm speed. He already features a huge stride down the mound and big hip/shoulder separation, and he still clearly has room for muscle on his frame. His low-90s changeup flashes huge tail, so much that Iriarte often struggles to command it, but his arm speed makes us want to project on this pitch in a big way. Iriarte is rather skinny and only showed premium velocity for roughly half of 2023. There's risk he doesn't maintain this velo bump, and he was ""only"" sitting 92-95 during a 2024 spring outing two weeks prior to the Dylan Cease trade, but because he's still projectable, there's also a possibility it will continue to trend up. There's a mix of pretty substantial long-term ceiling here, and also some relief risk.

His bat path is geared for huge lift, with some of the most consistent and extreme launch in all of professional baseball at 22-25 degrees on average the last two seasons. Pages' exit velocities are surprisingly low considering his in-game power output (he averaged 25 annual bombs across his ages-18-21 seasons) and the ferocity of his swings. Anecdotally, dips like that sometimes coincide with drastic changes in player physicality like what Pages has shown (Lewin Díaz is a recent example), and he might still progress in this way. Pages is probably always going to strike out a lot; it's inherent in his approach. He covers the inner two-thirds of the zone quite well, but his desire to pull and lift everything leaves him vulnerable on the outer edge. Pages doesn't have the raw power of a Teoscar Hernández or an Adam Duvall (Pages had 40 measurable raw at age 22), but he projects to be a similar kind of player: A strikeout-prone corner outfielder with some peak years of huge power and the occasional lean season with too many whiffs.

That power manifested in games more often in 2023 than it had in previous seasons, as Caissie doubled his homer count from 2022 and slugged .519 at Double-A Tennessee. His contact rate isn't great; in fact, in 2023 it was at the bottom of what there's precedent for among corner sluggers in the majors. But early on in 2024, Caissie's contact rates have been much better at Triple-A Iowa. His in-zone contact rate is north of 80%, his overall rate just above 70%, and those are more stable metrics than he showed in 2023. He also looks leaner and faster. All kinds of late-bloomer traits have been part of Caissie's profile since he was a draft prospect and he's still only 21. He's an enormous Canadian kid who didn't play a baseball game at night until 2021, after he had turned pro and been traded already. There are going to be a lot of strikeouts here, but Caissie projected to get to power sufficient to carry an everyday corner outfield profile even before he showed the little improvement to start this season.

He hit .282/.405/.423 in college and often worked multiple innings in relief. While he was viewed as a prospect on both sides of the ball, the teams most interested in Schwellenbach before the draft were the ones that thought he was only scratching the surface on the mound after having pitched for just a year in college. During his 2021 season at Nebraska, his fastball averaged 95 mph across most of the season but dipped down to 93 in his last two starts, and it was later determined that he needed Tommy John, which delayed his pro debut by a full year. Only when he was done rehabbing in 2023 did Schwellenbach begin his foray into starting. An IL stint (shoulder inflammation) limited him to 65 innings, but by the end of the season, he had stretched out to five and six innings per start and held mid-90s velocity the whole time. A hot start at High-A Rome in 2024 led to two quick promotions, first to Double-A Mississippi and then straight to Atlanta, where Schwellenbach has made three starts leading up to list publication. 
Schwellenbach has had a one-tick velo bump so far in 2024 and has also added a cutter to his already robust repertoire. He employs a slider-heavy approach against righties and throws the kitchen sink at lefties. He doesn't have dominant stuff right now, but you can project on some Schwellenbach's weapons (the changeup and brand new cutter, especially) because he's a good athlete who is new to starting. He's reached the big leagues just about a year after he transitioned into a rotation, which is incredible. I wonder what kind of innings limit he might be on given that he's never been stretched out to anything close to 100 innings in single season, but I think Schwellenbach will grow into a contender's fourth starter with reps.",,"31846"

He was signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2018 and immediately started turning heads when he posted a 150 wRC+ as a 17-year-old in rookie ball, and while he’s hit stumbling blocks along the way, his power has never really been an issue. More questionable was whether or not he’d perform despite a free-wheeling, slider-chasing approach that resulted in enough swing-and-miss to dampen his  slugging capability until 2022, when he started getting to his power at a new level. In 2023, he seemed to turn another corner, lowering his strikeout and swinging strike rates while working deeper counts against opposing pitchers. Not only did he reach significantly more full counts in 2023 (129) than he had in 2022 (86), but his performance in those counts improved, with his OPS skyrocketing from .610 to 1.061 on 3-2 offerings. His promotion to Triple-A came with a noticeable uptick in swinging strikes and strikeouts, but that type of hiccup is common as minor leaguers move up the ladder. Plus, Orelvis has now made relevant adjustments a couple of times. Even with the uptick in strikeouts, his slash line improved in every column at Buffalo, and he finished the season with a 105 wRC+ despite being several years younger than the average Triple-A player. Orelvis typically leaves the building to his pull-side, yanking hanging breaking balls out past the left field foul pole.
His bat is good enough to quiet the qualms about his best defensive fit. Orelvis has mostly played shortstop, but his time trended more toward third base and then finally second base, which he began to learn after his promotion to Buffalo. He’s not particularly rangy or skilled at any one spot. Martinez has good max-effort arm strength, but he throws from a weird, slingy, awkward-looking armslot. Second base seems the most comfortable fit for him overall, but even if he’s a defensive nomad, his power, along with the improvements he’s made at the plate in order to get to it more consistently, is enough to warrant finding room for him in a big league lineup.","yHLBXVb004Y","25967"

In spite of this, I'm not inclined to slide him or adjust his FV grade from last year's list. Abel still has most all of the ingredients needed to be an impact starter, he just isn't totally baked yet. The 22-year-old is still a lanky and projectable 6-foot-5, he has tremendous arm speed and bodily flexibility, and he'll occasionally touch triple digits (his fastballs averaged 96 mph throughout all of 2023) and show you plus secondary stuff, it's just that the timing of his arm swing and release varies too much for him to throw strikes consistently. This has been the case since he entered pro ball and it needs to improve for him to hit his ceiling, but for a 22-year-old built like Abel is, and who throws as hard as Abel does, this is not unusual or alarming. 
It is a little frustrating that some of Abel's blemishes have persisted for the last couple of years. His fastball shape isn't optimal, his slider would probably be nastier if it were harder and it often blends into Abel's curveball, and he still doesn't have great changeup feel. But Abel is freaky. His stride down the mound is huge, his hips, shoulders and upper back are incredibly loose and explosive, and all that energy ends up leaving his body through his fingertips and into the baseball. Ideally, he'll have functional four- and two-seam fastball variants at maturity and be able to work both north/south and east/west with his fastball. Abel has a strong natural proclivity for spinning his breaking stuff, but because his release is so inconsistent, so too is the shape and quality of those pitches. His mid-80s slurve is already an above-average pitch and could be a 70-grade shove machine at maturity. Abel will also flash a really good changeup once in a while; that pitch tends to be in the 86-89 mph range and feasts on hitters who have to cheat to catch up to his fastball. I'm projecting heavily on Abel's command in anticipation of him growing into his body and arm speed. If he can consistently locate his stuff, then Abel will be a front-end arm. If not, he's going to be a high-leverage reliever thanks to what I anticipate will be a 98-plus mph fastball if he's allowed to air things out one inning at a time.","Eqc625r-XdY","sa3014534"

Instead he signed for $3 million as the first pick in the 2021 third round and was developed as a two-way player for parts of two seasons before focusing on pitching in 2023. Things went well. Chandler made 25 starts, worked 111 innings (a 60-inning increase from the season before) and, after all that, his fastball was still humming in at 95-96 mph in a dominant, one-hit season-capping outing for Double-A Altoona. 
Back at Altoona in 2024, Chandler continues to impress with his raw stuff but has generated mixed results from a strike-throwing standpoint. He's sitting 97 and working with plus extension and above-average vertical movement, allowing his fastball to play up a tick. His changeup has taken a leap in 2024 and looks like it will soon be Chandler's best secondary pitch. It often has bat-missing action in the 86-90 mph range, and automated pitch tagging algorithms often conflate it with a two-seamer, so a note to team personnel that pitch data readouts about its performance may not be accurate. His slider hasn't taken quite the same leap, but Chandler's feel for locating it is slowly improving. Here again we have a bit of a problem with automated pitch tagging, which sees Chandler as having a cutter. This pitch looks like a cutter on paper but given Chandler's high three-quarters arm slot, the pitch has downhill angle and two-plane movement that looks and plays like a slider in real life. It hasn't been missing bats consistently in 2024, but we think its ceiling is still pretty exciting because of how hard Chandler throws it. 
Though his delivery is a bit more effortful than most big league starters and he's occasionally struggled with walks as a pro, Chandler's athleticism and multi-sport background make us want to continue projecting on his command deep into his 20s. There's still development happening here (for instance, Chandler made his first start on four days rest not long before list publication) and we want to see how his velocity responds to a more typical big league starter workload, but so far Chandler's dev is going as well as could have been hoped when he was drafted, and he's tracking like a mid-rotation starter.

He's striking out more than anticipated but getting to enough power to offset it. Much of his swing-and-miss is occurring outside the strike zone. It's not that Busch is chasing a lot, but he's struggling to contact pitches out of the zone much more than the average big league hitter (major league average O-Contact is 56%; Busch is at 48.4%). There's bigger hit tool and on-base ceiling here than Busch has shown to this point. He's been selective for his entire career and as that skill starts to surface at the big league level, it will buoy both his OBP and contact abilities. Again, Busch has been good so far, but he'd feel like a more stable hitter if he weren't striking out a third of the time, especially since he's officially a 1B/DH-only defender now.","2A597xbLtFA","26319"

Pitchers with changeups as good as Thorpe’s and who throw as many strikes as he does tend to be high-floor propositions who pitch forever. His low-80s changeup, which he locates at will, has a ton of tail, and his ultra-short arm stroke helps trick hitters into seeing fastball out of his hand. The effectiveness of Thorpe’s slider (more average in terms of raw stuff) and fastball (below-average at just 90–92 mph) is enabled by his precise feel for location. He can sink his fastball down and to his arm side, or run a four-seam version of it past hitters at the letters. The Yankees coaxed a little more heat out of Thorpe (who sat 88–91 in college) during his time in their org, but not enough to give him impact velocity. The White Sox have not demonstrated a consistent ability to do that, and the 91-93 mph he showed during his 2024 spring run with the Padres may be all the velo he ever has. Thorpe will throw the occasional cutter or curveball in an obvious fastball count to keep hitters guessing, but those pitches don't currently have any more utility than that, though we think the cutter eventually will.

His best contact comes via traditional low-ball lefty lift, though Ballesteros is adept at flattening his bat path to spray high fastballs the opposite way. His spray chart has shifted from a more balanced all-fields spray to more frequent oppo contact early in 2024, though this appears to be more about how Double-A pitchers are approaching him than a regression in Ballesteros' bat speed or ability to turn on the baseball. 
He's a squat, heavier young guy, but Ballesteros is athletic in the batter's box. His swing has a leg kick with a big hip turn and explosive hip-and-hand separation. Athletes with maxed-out builds like this can be vulnerable to sudden and early physical regression, and this sort of risk is associated with Ballesteros' profile in the same way it was with Alek Manoah's and Alejandro Kirk's. For now, Ballesteros looks sufficiently athletic and he has made enough technical progress to be more comfortably considered a catching prospect than before. He is still not great, but not many 20-year-old catchers pushed to Double-A are. Ballesteros' best defensive attribute is his arm accuracy. He doesn't have a hose, but he has a surprisingly quick release for a guy his size and throws a lot of accurate one-hoppers to second in the 1.95-2.00 second range, sometimes from his knees. Ballesteros will show you a little bit of every ball-blocking technique — backpicking to his right, hunched over balls right in front of him, moving laterally to his left — and he is by far the worst at the last of those. If he can clean that up and become a better receiver, then he's going to catch pretty comfortably. All the risk associated with Ballesteros comes from characteristics one can assess visually. He has a very strong statistical profile at a premium position that he looks more likely to play now than a year ago. He's tracking similar to Austin Wells.",,"sa3015713"

Here at FanGraphs, we took the under and had a late-second/early-third round grade on him. In 2023, his first full pro season, Melton slashed .245/.334/.467 with 23 homers while going 46-for-53 in stolen base attempts. His 2024 was off to a very good start at Double-A Corpus Christi (especially from a contact standpoint) when Melton was shut down with a wrist issue a couple of weeks before list publication. 
Melton has plus raw power and hits the ball hard with plus-plus consistency, though there isn't drastic loft in his bat path. The strength and athleticism in his lower body has leveled up since he signed, and he can move the barrel around the zone to make crude, imprecise (but hard) contact to all fields. It’s a slug-over-hit profile to the eye, but it's more balanced when you look at Melton's statistical performance. He adds an additional layer of offensive value with his ability to swipe bags at an efficient rate. The problem here is that Melton has really struggled against lefties and is hitting about .185 against them as a pro. It's difficult to give him an everyday player's FV grade when this is true. 
It becomes more plausible if you think Melton can do enough on defense to impact the game even on days when he faces a southpaw. He's an above-average runner who covers an average amount of ground in center field, with his ball skills and relative lack of athleticism at the catchpoint causing a slight downtick in his defense grade. He's not an ideal center field fit, but he can play there if you need him to, and we think he'd be a plus left fielder if he was deployed there all the time. That's enough to push Melton into the 50 FV tier and onto the Top 100 list. We expect production similar to what Kerry Carpenter has done except with better defense, an above-average rate of production but not an omni-situational player due to his issues versus lefties.",,"sa3019988"

He went to school and raked, slashing .339/.411/.603 while building experience at a variety of positions (second, short, third, left) before transitioning to third base full-time during his draft year. He was one of the more well-rounded and proven prospects from a loaded 2023 draft, and fell deeper (12th overall) than players of his caliber tend to because of the class' depth up top. Troy spent about a month at High-A Hillsboro after signing and was assigned there again to start 2024. As of list publication, he has a career OPS hovering around .730 and is striking out more than he was in college. He is currently on the IL with a hamstring injury. 
The Diamondbacks have deployed Troy at shortstop, but he doesn't look great there. He's very tightly wound, a much more explosive athlete than an elegant and fluid one, and he can't put his body in position to make all the throws a shortstop has to make. He looked like he was getting very comfortable at third base toward the end of the 2023 college season. He plays lower to the ground when his hips get to be square than when he has to flip them to range laterally as a middle infielder, and his throws are crisper and more accurate from third than shortstop. It might be worth it to give Troy some reps in center field. He's a flat out 80-grade runner and, in our estimation, has a better shot of developing into being a good center fielder than he does of becoming a passable shortstop. 
Offensively, you can get Troy out by executing breaking stuff away from him, which he either rolls over or swings inside of entirely. He otherwise has really excellent plate coverage and packs surprising punch for a hitter his size, which has been a feature of his profile since high school. His scissor-kick swing is geared for banging high fastballs into the opposite field gap. Troy's ceiling is highest if he can play an up-the-middle position, but his most direct path to the bigs is probably via exclusivity at third base. He's projected here as an everyday third baseman, perhaps transitioning from a superutility debut into being the everyday guy at the hot corner when Eugenio Suárez's contract is up.","qj3aAqMw6_Q","sa3022561"

He was on the short list of players who entered 2023 with a chance to ""Chourio,"" i.e. leap into the top 10 overall prospect mix within the next year. Instead, Bleis had a bad first month of full-season ball, subluxated his left shoulder during a swing at the end of May, and ended up needing season-ending surgery. Sent back to Low-A to start 2024, Bleis got off to a good start and was quickly promoted to Greenville, where the pace of play has been a bit of a rude awakening. 
Bleis has all-world bat speed and rare rotational athleticism. His best swings produce shocking raw power for such a lithe young hitter, and he might still grow into more. He can go through stretches where his swing decisions are pretty terrible, but that has been much better so far in 2024. There's some chase-related hit tool risk here, but if Bleis becomes more selective as he matures, he would have a complete (and very exciting) offensive skill set. He also has the speed and range to play center, but he's procedurally raw when it comes to things like communicating with the other outfielders and where he decides to throw the baseball. That applies to pretty much every aspect of Bleis' game — he's fairly immature on the field in a way that evokes a young Jose Siri, as do his tools. In the days leading up to list publication, Bleis K'd on a pitch clock violation and misplayed multiple balls in play into extra base hits, one of the times half jogging to recover as the runner sprinted around the bases. At some point he's going to need to grow up and iron that stuff out, but he's too young and talented to exclude from this FV tier. A meteoric rise is unlikely as long as Bleis takes a somewhat unserious approach to this stuff, but over time, I believe his talent will shine in an everyday center field capacity.",,"sa3016834"

When he can actually get a throw to the bag off, his Patrick Bailey-style sidearm release works ok, but he so often botches or fumbles his exchange that he doesn't give himself a chance to get the runner. Liranzo mostly utilizes a traditional crouch when receiving and is a below-average framer and ball-blocker. Both those skills are more tenable and within the range of big league viability than his arm, but at Liranzo's size and age, it's no guarantee they'll stay that way. 
There is huge switch-hitting power here — Liranzo hit 24 bombs in the Cal League, hit a ball 114 mph, and had a 48% hard-hit rate last year. He can hit for power from the left side even when he isn't taking his best swing, and he's dangerous from the right side even though he uses super conservative footwork, generating everything with a shift in his weight and the strength of his hands. Liranzo doesn't have great feel for the barrel, which is typical for a young a switch-hitter, let alone one of atypical size. His 65% contact rate is below the threshold of any 2023 big league first baseman (Bryce Harper's was at 68%, the next lowest was 72%), so there's substantial Quad-A risk here if Liranzo can't catch. Whether or not he stays back there is the difference between Cal Raleigh and M.J. Melendez from a production standpoint. Arm strength is perhaps a little less teachable than other issues young catchers often need to fix, which is worrisome in this case. He has a little more minor league experience than some of the other prospects who present a combination of extreme ceiling and risk, and Liranzo's high-end outcomes are driving his placement here.",,"sa3015790"

Any time a hitter this size comes along, there are justifiable doubts about whether or not he'll be able to catch up to pro velocity. Eldridge looks relatively short to the baseball, especially for a guy his size. He can be a little long getting to the bottom of the zone right now, but he has a surprising ability to get on top of high fastballs; most lefty hitters built like him are the opposite and have low-ball tendencies. There is probably always going to be a heavy dose of strikeouts here (as there are with Olson), but Eldridge's combination of power and patience is going to make him a potent offensive threat. Whether he ends up playing right field or first base is probably going to be immaterial. He's quite a ways from the big leagues and there is some hit tool risk here, but Eldridge projects as a middle-of-the-order-force with elite power. 
Eldridge was shut down after six games in 2024 with an undisclosed injury (it sounds like it isn't even listed in EBIS, which is odd), but scouts who cover the Giants org seem to think it's something from which Eldridge will return from relatively soon.","vnNG9LhpzEs","sa3022757"

Throughout 2022 and 2023, he sat 94-97 with riding life and would frequently top out in the 98-99 range. Out the gate in 2024, he's been steady in the 95-96 range with arm-side ride. Dollander's hard cutter/slider looks more like the latter the deeper into games he pitches. As that pitch slows down from the 87-89 mph range to the 84-86 mph band throughout a start, it tends to add length and have more typical slider shape. An upper-70s curveball and mid-80s changeup sit in the back seat together; each had less than 10% usage in 2022, and combined for just 14% usage in 2023. He's going to have to lean on those pitches more in pro ball — Dollander's fastball is good, but not so good that he'll be able to deploy it 65-70% of the time (his 2023 and early 2024 marks) against big leaguers. Dollander's arm speed portends changeup growth, but the ones he throws now tend to sail on him. His curveball has distinct shape from his slider and has fine depth for an upper-70s curve, he just doesn't consistently land his location with this pitch either. Dollander's very similar to the high-variance developmental arms on a typical Top 100 list, a potential no. 3/4 starter with pretty clear developmental checkpoints (fastball command, third pitch quality) to hit on his way there.","KVMjdEqwN6E","sa3023361"

Ranked 12th on the FanGraphs 2023 draft board, he signed for $4.5 million as the 10th overall pick in a loaded draft. 
Meyer checks nearly every scouting and analytical box. His 6-foot-5 frame is lanky and projectable, his arm works loose and free, he has a lower-than-average release height, and he can create huge action on his secondary pitches. Though he was routinely in the mid-90s as a high schooler, Meyer has been more 92-95 so far in pro ball. Both his mid-80s slider and changeup are generating plus rates of whiff. Meyer will also show you a devastating two-plane breaking ball featuring both huge depth and lateral action. In high school, it was sometimes easy to identify out of his hand because it was so much slower than his fastballs, sometimes 20 mph slower than the pitch before, but that gap has closed in pro ball, as his slider is averaging 83 mph. Meyer's changeup, which he didn't often have cause to throw in high school games, might end up being his best pitch. His arm slot helps impart a lot of lateral action on his cambio, which is now a few ticks slower than his high school version. His arm swing is really long and yet Meyer has pretty good feel for locating all of his offerings. 
Velocity dip aside (and that's pretty natural once a kid's workload shifts from high school to pro ball), Meyer looks like a fairly stable prospect as far as teenage pitchers are concerned. He has the frame, stuff, and command of a mid-rotation starter, but of course he also has the risks associated with any pitcher his age. Given the Marlins' timeline to contention (likely several years away), it's unlikely Meyer will be on the fast track to Miami. He's more likely to track in line with his chalk 40-man timeline, putting him on pace to debut late in 2027.",,"sa3022945"

He's posted a 144 wRC+ during a 2024 first half spent at Double-A Portland, where he began his first full pro season. He tracks pitches well and his barrel stays in the hitting zone for a long time, enabling Teel to let pitches travel a little deeper and spray them to the opposite field. His vertical bat path and high-effort style of swinging helps produce impressive in-game power for a medium-framed hitter, and Teel has shown that he can make a roughly average rate of contact using this style of hitting. You can beat him with velo up-and-away and with backfoot breaking stuff, but you'd better make sure that breaking ball finishes because most of his power occupies the middle-in part of the zone. It's a very solid offensive skill set for a catcher. 
Teel does not have the prototypical size and bulk of an everyday catcher, and there are times when his lack of strength impacts his receiving and pitch framing, but he does virtually everything else well on defense. His raw arm strength is fair, but Teel's exchange is lightning quick and he's often able to make accurate throws even when awkward pitch locations force him to contort his body to do so. He's also an incredibly mobile ball-blocker, especially for someone who catches from such a wide, one-knee'd base. At the rate Teel is performing and climbing, it's possible we could see him in Boston at some point next year, debuting in a timeshare with the similarly small Connor Wong that would allow Teel to get his feet wet while relieving some of the position's physical burdens for both of them. There might be roster flexibility considerations (like Reese McGuire being out of options) that complicate this, but it's a way to onboard Teel while also maximizing Wong, which is fortuitous and exciting.",,"sa3022886"

As a sophomore, Wilson had the lowest strikeout rate among qualified college hitters at a microscopic 2.8%, and only swung and missed a total of 18 times as a junior. He posted a whopping 10-to-1 ball-in-play-to-whiff ratio during the 2023 season, ended his college career hitting .361/.419/.558, and became the sixth pick in a loaded draft. Despite his collegiate success, Wilson was a fairly divisive amateur prospect. He was rail thin, and an overwhelming majority of his contact was incredibly light and on the ground. The concerns about his ultimate ceiling were similar to doubts about Nick Madrigal's ability to get to meaningful power. Wilson is a better defensive player than Madrigal and arguably has room for strength on his frame, which he appeared to be actualizing when he reported to camp this spring. 
Wilson's has incredible barrel accuracy, flattening his path to impact pitches at the top of the zone and dipping to scoop low ones, which he often drives the other way. He can poke pitches on the outer edge to the opposite field, but he does most of his extra-base damage (which is rare) to his pull side. Even though he looks visibly stronger, Wilson's 2024 contact is still pretty light. He may only ever have a one-note offensive profile, but it's the most important note, and a very loud note. One wrinkle that has cropped up here is that Wilson has become ridiculously aggressive in the box and is walking at a 1% clip as of list publication. Small walk rates are common among players who make high-end rates of contact; guys like Luis Arraez, Madrigal, David Fletcher, Martín Prado, and countless others have had varying degrees of big league success despite not walking very much. What separates Wilson from many players of this ilk is that he's a quality shortstop defender, and he has better long-term athletic projection than many of them because of his lanky build. Erick Aybar and Andrelton Simmons (Wilson's defense isn't nearly <em>that</em> good) are more precise performance comps for what I expect from Wilson's arc. He should stabilize Oakland's shortstop situation within the next couple of years but he doesn't have monstrous ceiling.",,"33266"

Scott slashed .303/.369/.425 during the regular season and .286/.388/.417 in Arizona; he also stole 112 bases combined between the two. Injuries to Lars Nootbaar, Tommy Edman, and Dylan Carlson forced the Cardinals to skip Scott over Triple-A completely and put him on the 2024 Opening Day roster. He flopped in the majors for a couple of weeks before being sent back to Triple-A Memphis once Nootbaar was healthy and has slowly begun to get going on offense again. Scott is an 80 runner with fabulous feel for center field and double-killing gap-to-gap range. His defense alone would be enough to make him a major league role player. Scott is rail thin and not especially strong, but he makes an above-average rate of contact and has other soft skills like baserunning and bunting that act as the cherry on top of a catalytic offensive profile. He reached safely on 17 bunts last year, which is reminiscent of TJ Friedl, who had a lot of success in 2023 as a very similar player. Premium center field defense and speed give Scott a fourth outfielder's floor, while his rate of contact and pesky bat-handling abilities elevate his profile into more of a regular role, especially if he can get stronger.",,"31349"

He began 2022, his first full pro season, on a tear before injuring his back in early May. House did not look the same after he returned. He struck out a third of the time and posted an OPS of just .602 before being shut down for the remainder of the season in mid-June. We thought it was safe to assume he was playing through injury, and House was left on last offseason's Top 100 list under the assumption that he'd return healthy in 2023. He basically did, and while we still have some apprehension about aspects of his swing and his plate coverage, a fully actualized House has star-level ability, tools that give him rare enough ceiling to value him among the top 100 prospects even though he still has bust risk.
House rewarded our patience by pulverizing Low-A pitching in 2023, generating a 142 wRC+ in his first 36 games back with Fredericksburg and a 145 wRC+ in a couple of weeks at High-A Wilmington. He has plus raw power right now (48% hard-hit rate, 113 mph max exit velo) and should grow into more as he fills out. His contact and chase rates (68% and 36%, respectively) are suspect, and some of what we're seeing with House's swing does give us pause about him continuing to make sufficient levels of contact now that he's reached Double-A. He's got a very upright base when he swings and tends to step in the bucket, both of which leave House's plate coverage lacking. His poor breaking ball recognition compounds this, and he's going to have to do a better job of either closing his front side during his swing so he can contact sliders on the outer edge, or laying off them entirely. House definitely did a better job of pulling the ball in 2023, and he's still played so few pro games due to injury that we're bullish on his ability to make adjustments, even though we're quite sure he's going to need to soon. 
The oppo power and chase combo here isn't all that different from same-aged Josh Jung. Perhaps most impressively, House's defense has been fantastic. Because he's so big, House (who was a high school shortstop) was sometimes projected to right field, as it's rare for athletes his size to stay on the infield. But his ability to bend and move at his size is incredible, he has plus hands, he can throw on the run, and his feeds to the other bases are accurate and timely. He not only looks like a sure bet to stay at third but is potentially an impact defender there, which is especially impressive considering he's not all that far removed from a season-altering back injury. There's still a ton of volatility here, but the power upside is significant, and House's defense gives him another tool that's relatively resistant to slumping and should help keep his profile afloat if it turns out his hit tool is a long-term problem.","LgJWO0o1GtM","sa3017694"

Rojas has some of the best hitting hands in the minor leagues, his timing at the dish is exceptional, he can create precocious power in a short mechanical distance, and he can move the baseball to all fields. Many of these characteristics act as force multipliers with one another, and combine to make Rojas a skillful and dangerous young hitter. Despite an approach that is a bit more expansive than it should be, Rojas is putting balls in play at an impressive rate for a 19-year-old infielder in the mid-minors. He mostly has gap-to-gap doubles power right now, but he should add enough power to his well-built, medium frame to make him a pole-to-pole power threat at maturity. 
Where Rojas struggles some is on defense. He has mostly played shortstop as a pro (and as of list publication, has played there exclusively so far in 2024), but he's not as athletically gifted as most big league shortstops, with his range and throwing accuracy in particular falling short of that position's standards right now. He's going to be a better fit at second or third, and there's risk he moves off the dirt entirely. The further down the defensive spectrum Rojas falls, the more important it is for him to hit despite below-average plate discipline.

Just months after he signed, Celesten came to the states for a couple of weeks during minor league spring training and then quickly returned to the Dominican Republic, where he suffered a hamstring strain before the DSL season began, an injury that basically cost him the entire season except for a couple of games in Arizona during Fall Instructional League. The Mariners kept his promotion pace on schedule in 2024, as Celesten spent the spring in Arizona for basically all of minor league spring training, extended spring, and then the start of the official Complex League schedule. He's been an absolute beast in the desert, producing an OPS around .980 so far in the ACL. 
Celesten's physicality stands out immediately and, as he approaches age 19, would stand out in a big league clubhouse. He probably weighs 15 or 20 pounds more than when he signed and every bit of it is muscle; Celesten's shoulders look like he's shoplifting grapefruits up his sleeves. This allows him to make a remarkable amount of hard contact with an easy, low-effort swing. He had a hard-hit rate well above 50% across the first 60 plate appearances of the season. Celesten's left-handed swing has a beautifully balanced leg kick that takes advantage of his athleticism without getting out of control. His load from that side is pretty aggressive and deep, with the head of the bat tilted toward the pitcher as he prepares to unwind. You can see in the way Celesten's lower body, hips, and wrists rotate throughout his swing that this is a pretty special and powerful athlete. His swing is currently geared for low-ball contact and he's going to be tested by belt-high fastballs as he machetes deeper into the full-season pitching jungle, but if this guy ever learns how to alter the posture of his body as a means of covering the top of the zone so that his hands can continue to work with their natural loft, he's going to be a problem. His right-handed swing is nowhere near as authoritative and is often late, but you can see the athletic elements of his cut from that side, too. 
On defense, I've shifted my forecast for Celesten to second base. He was running in the 4.4s from the right side and the 4.3s from the left for me during the spring (I have no ACL run times from him because his contact quality has been too good for him to ever have to run hard), and I also think Celesten's size at maturity will be bigger than the typical shortstop's. The gigantic outcome here would be for the Mariners to get a Ketel Marte mulligan. Ketel's righty swing is too good for the comp to be flush, but that sort of power-hitting second baseman in the Marte/Albies mold feels like Celesten's ceiling, while production akin to Ryan McMahon or Brandon Lowe, or maybe even Nolan Gorman if Celesten gets really big, is a more realistic.",,"sa3023381"

He moved into the Lions' rotation in 2021 and had a great season — 91 IP, 95 K, just 98 baserunners allowed — despite sitting mostly 90-91 mph. The Yankees shut him down for the post-draft period of 2021, and when play began in 2022, Warren had a new breaking ball and much more velocity, which he has sustained across the last two seasons at Somerset and Scranton. 
Even though he isn't on their 40-man roster, Warren is arguably in a better position to crack the Yankees' 2024 rotation than other pitchers who are. He has a better track record of strike-throwing and recent health than Luis Gil or Clayton Beeter. Warren checks every scouting box aside from the one in the ""pretty delivery"" column. His cross-bodied mechanics and head whack are more violent than is ideal, but Warren has now sustained good stuff across anywhere between 90 and 130 innings in each of the last three years, evidence he can succeed despite this delivery. His repertoire has grown to five useful pitches, with the best two being his heavy sinker, which has periods where it's parked in the 94-95 mph range, and his sweeper-style slider, which moves similarly to Blake Treinen's. These two pitches diverge horizontally in a way that gives hitters fits. Warren's sweeper garnered swinging strikes at an incredible 20% clip in 2023, and his sinker generated a 67% groundball rate. Warren also has a four-seam variant that he runs up the ladder as a chase pitch, and he has an upper-80s cutter that has become a more useful way to attack lefties than his middling changeup, which has a good bit of movement but is too similar to his sinker's shape and velocity to be very disruptive. There might be room for growth in the offspeed/changeup realm for Warren yet; some of his best cambios are the ones that cut on him and look more like splitters. A true splitter might give him a dynamic swing-and-miss weapon versus lefties, which he currently lacks. Otherwise, Warren does a little bit of everything. His pitch mix compares closely to Joe Musgrove's (his command isn't quite <em>that</em> great) and, similarly, Warren profiles as a big league ready, mid-rotation starter.",,"30182"

Festa has had a pretty significant velo spike in pro ball and reached Triple-A in 2023 at the very end of a solid season mostly spent at Double-A Wichita. Since turning pro, the 6-foot-6 right-hander's velocity has grown year-over-year until he reached the 94-97 mph range his fastball has resided in for the last two seasons. His approach to pitching with his heater has changed and become less efficient as, due to a lack of explosive movement on the pitch, Festa has begun to take a slider-first approach. In 2024, his changeup usage is also up; there are entire starts where he throws his fastball least of all. He often tries to get ahead of hitters with sliders that drop into the top of the strike zone, and when Festa is locating both his slider and changeup to opposite corners of the plate, each is capable of missing bats against hitters of either handedness. Both secondary pitches generated above-average rates of chase and miss in 2023 and have so far in 2024 as well. 
Festa has pitched about 100 innings each of the last two completed seasons without seeing a velocity drop off. All of his offerings are pretty firm — even his slider and changeup are often 87-88 mph — and without a pitch that more drastically alters hitters' timing, he may end up generating more weak contact than outright whiffs against big league hitters. Even though Festa is 24, his rare combination of size and athleticism might portend another gear of arm strength and/or command as he continues to refine the feel for his endless limbs. He's projected here as an innings-eating no. 4 starter on a contender who might have peak years as an impact mid-rotation guy if either his command or velocity levels up one more time. Festa could debut late in 2024, but he's more likely to permanently entrench himself on the big league roster in 2025 and beyond.",,"30056"

Back at Norfolk to start 2023, he threw more strikes, entered the Top 100 list, and made his big league debut shortly before this org update. 
Povich's statuesque frame and effortless delivery are innings-eater characteristics, and his ultra short arm action and his body's direct line to the plate have allowed him to throw plenty of strikes, save for his Triple-A blip last year. He lacks great tactile feel for release; Povich's style of attack is more about control than command. Povich added a cutter in 2023 and now has three breaking pitches with glove-side action that run the gamut in terms of shape and velocity. Unpredictability and deception are a huge part of how he succeeds. His arm stays tucked behind his body until the very last bit of his delivery prior to release, and it makes hitters very uncomfortable. Most of Povich's secondary offerings generated an average or slightly better rate of swing-and-miss in the minors, which has predictably dialed down to average during his small big league sample. Despite lacking a dominant offering, he should be a valuable mid-rotation starter because of his durability and repertoire depth.",,"30055"

I was relatively low on him prior to the draft, but the Mariners made his swing better pretty quickly after he signed. He still has a lot of extraneous movement in his hands, but Farmelo looked good during backfield activity and then during Modesto's 2023 postseason run. Assigned to Modesto again in 2024, Farmelo was slashing .264/.398/.421 across 221 plate appearances when he blew his ACL while making a slightly awkward catch in the outfield. A typical ACL rehab puts him on the shelf until the middle of next season. It's a developmental blow to a prospect who is much more talented than he is polished. Farmelo has the footspeed to play center field and makes some incredible plays deep in the gap, but he's very raw from a procedural and fundamentals standpoint, things like fielding the ball on the ground and where/how hard to throw the baseball. Farmelo has enormous ceiling as a power and speed center fielder if he can season his defensive ability, and the ACL tear robs him of reps. 
Farmelo has a big, physical 6-foot-2 frame. His speed is great on its own, but it's absolutely incredible how fast Farmelo is for his size. Whether that's still true on the other side of the ACL tear is also going to have a huge impact on his potential outcomes. Farmelo can create big power in a short mechanical distance at the dish and he has pretty good bat control, but he still has a bunch of pre-swing movement in his hands that impacts the consistency of both. A hugely positive thing is that despite this, Farmelo was consistently pulling the ball with power before he got hurt, including fastballs. That's not often the case with hitters this size or who have funky swings. This is a rare player who has actual five-tool potential, and if he hadn't torn his ACL, I think you could make an argument that he's the best prospect in this system. He's certainly one of its two most gifted. Unfortunately, what is already a risky profile has now been heightened by severe injury.",,"sa3023362"

The Rangers international scouting group was originally connected to a player named Camilo Diaz for a rumored bonus of $3 million but seemingly diverted to Walcott around this time (Diaz signed with Houston). Walcott signed in January of 2023 and spent a big chunk of spring training in Arizona, where he stood apart from his peers on the backfields because of his bat speed. He went to the D.R. for the start of the DSL season, but was quickly promoted to the Arizona Complex League and lit things up for a month before opponents realized he couldn't recognize a breaking ball. He ended up having a .273/.325/.524 line in Arizona with a terrifying 6.4% walk rate and 32.5% strikeout rate. The Rangers sent Walcott, who turned 18 during spring training, straight to High-A at the start of 2024. As of this update, he is somehow sporting an above-average Sally League wRC+ even though he remains sushi raw in most facets of the game.
Walcott has immense physical ability and long-term projection. He looks like a future NFL wide receiver in his uniform and has the kind of pull power you'd expect from a prospect built like that. This is a 6-foot-4 teenager with elite hand speed and power projection who is sufficiently athletic that he might develop into a viable shortstop defender. He has one of the biggest ceilings in all of minor league baseball, but he'll have to traverse a great developmental distance to max out. Walcott's swing and feel to hit need a ton of polish. The timing of his footwork in the box isn't great and he ends up lunging at breakers, plus Walcott's swing is driven by his bottom hand in a path that slopes down unless he's making contact way out in front of the plate, and he often has no chance of hitting pitches on the outer edge. It's a long swing that so far has been enabled by elite bat speed (Walcott is generating plus big league peak exit velos as a freaking 18-year-old) and it might require eventual adjustment, but rather than intervene right now, I think it's fine to see if Walcott's timing and feel to hit come naturally over time. 
Walcott has a fuzzy defensive projection because of his size and error-prone early career look at short. He just isn't very good at fielding the baseball yet. Everything happens a beat too slow for him on defense, from his first step to his exchange, but again we're talking about an 18-year-old who is only halfway through his second pro season. Independent of his hands and internal clock improving, Walcott might eventually move from shortstop to third base just because of his size at maturity. If that's the case, it's more important for his hit tool to become meaningfully better. Walcott's offensive ceiling looks like Javier Báez's peak. I know the Rangers have been aggressive with his promotion pace but this guy is not on the fast track. It's probably going to take a while, but it'll be fun to watch this play out.",,"sa3021069"

He transferred to Florida for his junior year and had a nearly identical season, this time blowing away SEC hitters for most of the spring. He ranked sixth on our 2023 draft board, but fell to Atlanta at no. 24 overall due to his perceived relief risk and the quality of the rest of the class. It has the feel of a Tim Duncan-era Spurs pick, an absolute coup for a contender that tends to get the most out of their own prospects and could use, at worst, another late-inning weapon in the near future. Waldrep made it to the big leagues less than a year after he was drafted, debuting a few days prior to list publication. 
Waldrep's approach to pitching is such that he likely won't work efficiently as a starter. His fastball is surprisingly hittable considering its velocity and Waldrep's vertical arm angle, which should theoretically be helping him create bat-missing, riding life on his heater. He often has to work above the zone with his fastball for it to be effective, and Waldrep runs deep counts because of this. The headline pitch in his arsenal is a cartoonish split changeup, which has incredible fading action and has missed bats at an elite rate in pro ball. The lone thing stopping this offering from receiving an 80 grade is Waldrep's tendency to leave it hanging, though often it's nasty enough to avoid damage even when he does. He has more or less scrapped his college curveball since the draft and has instead made use of a 84-89 mph cutter/slider. His ability to routinely land that pitch for a strike contributes to Waldrep's starter projection here, along with his demonstrated durability and plus athleticism. Similar to Reese Olson from a stuff standpoint, and to Drey Jameson in terms of his delivery and athleticism, Waldrep has a no. 3 starter's ceiling and a closer's floor.",,"33527"

Tink's changeup took a huge leap forward in 2023 and has not only become his best pitch, but one of the better changeups in the entire minor leagues. He'll also flash the occasional plus breaking ball, but not consistently. Hence's fastball wasn't finishing quite as well at the end of 2023 as it was when he looked like a Bryce Miller clone with better secondary stuff. Ideally he'd continue to get physically stronger for the purposes of durability, an area where we think Hence has plateaued. He still looks skinny in 2024, and his fastball is missing bats at a shockingly low rate and has lost a tick compared to last year. He's a good on-mound athlete, but he's on the smaller side and added strength might help him have the stamina to finish his pitches more consistently.

He coasted through A-ball and was given a quick hook to Double-A after the first month of the 2024 season. 
Bloss throws from a high slot that, along with his plus extension, generates significant carry on his 93-96 mph four-seamer; the pitch has a 31% miss rate so far in 2024. He also has a deep secondary mix to back up the fastball. His 76-81 mph curveball is a very vertical breaker. He'll adjust the amount of depth on it, sometimes throwing a deep “freeze” type, while at others, he'll shorten it up for more drastic snap action. Bloss does something similar with his slider in that he'll throw ones with hard, two-plane shape while others are shorter, more cutter-like offerings; both shapes regularly show average teeth while flashing a tick above. Bloss’ changeup has the furthest to go to be an average weapon for him, but he's a small school arm who we think is benefitting from pro instruction and we believe it’ll get there. The best ones he'll throw have late diving action and a hint of fade, though he’s still prone to frequently throwing ones that have very minimal action. Bloss is a fairly explosive, whippy-armed athlete with below-average body control and frame composition. We're skeptical the improvements he's made as a strike-thrower in 2024 will stick, but the way his fastball plays doesn't make that a strictly necessary aspect of his profile.

The Rangers quickly overhauled Rosario's delivery, most notably his arm slot, which is now much more vertical. It's totally changed the way Rosario's fastball plays without sacrificing his arm strength or the quality of either secondary pitch. There are many people in baseball who are jealous of the Rangers for this one, and others who think Rosario should be furious with the staff at Miami for failing to help him improve in college, as it probably cost him a lot of money.

He's posted gaudy strikeout totals in pro ball thanks mostly to his trademark changeup, which has a chance to be an elite pitch and has an absolutely absurd 60% miss rate in the early going of 2024. Whisenhunt's control has dipped substantially, and he's posted walk rates in the teens since entering the upper levels. This, plus the lack of a dynamic third pitch, had us consider sliding Whisenhunt out of the Top 100 on this update. We like how the shape of his upper-70s curveball interacts with the way Whisenhunt uses his fastball (a vertical attack), but he babies the curveball into the zone in an identifiable way. He needs to throw that pitch with more conviction, but we think it has the potential to be an average pitch. You could feasibly be worried that Whisenhunt will end up on a trajectory like Chris Paddack, where his lack of a third pitch takes a minute to catch up to him, but Whisenhunt's changeup might be even better than Paddack's and his fastball has better power pitcher's utility at the letters. There's relief risk here but, assuming that comes with a velo boost, Whisenhunt could have a 60-grade pitch and an 80-grade one and simply be an awesome backend option.

Rada's defense is easily the most special and advanced part of his game. His range, routes, and balls skills all project to be plus if they aren't already. His poise and comfort out there is incredible for a player his age, and Rada's future defense grade is only capped by his speed, which is ""merely"" plus. On offense, Rada looks physically overmatched by Double-A pitching. He tracks pitches well, and his swing is smooth and short, but he just can't swing that bat very hard yet and makes a lot of soft, groundball contact. Projecting on Rada's strength is complicated by his size. He's a smaller fella (this guy's listed height dropped two inches after MLB's independent measurement this spring), not the typical 6-foot-1 teenager who you could see adding 20 or so pounds of muscle over time. Guys like Adam Eaton and Cedric Mullins (maybe the most flush comp to Rada's game) provide examples of what it looks like when an outfielder this size succeeds.

The visual scouting report of Caba's hit tool was strong when he was an amateur, and now the data (insofar as DSL performance data can be useful) indicates he may have a superlative future as a contact hitter. On tape, you can see him manipulating the barrel with precocious skill for a teenage switch hitter, enough that I feel comfortable pushing his future hit tool projection a grade above where I had it when Caba was an amateur. 
I've buried the lede a bit here because what makes Caba very special is his defense. His footwork and actions are ridiculous, among the most deft and electric I've seen on a shortstop, reminiscent of José Iglesias. There are some overall similarities with a young Francisco Lindor in terms of Caba's build, glove, and switch-hitting, though Lindor had substantially more power at Caba's age. 
Frequent readers know I love to the use the draft as a lens through which to FV pro teenagers, and in Caba's case, I think you can argue he'd have gone as high as sixth in the 2023 draft (where Oakland took contact maven Jacob Wilson) and no lower than 22nd, where Seattle drafted hit-tool stalwart Colt Emerson (who probably should have gone much higher than that). I do worry about repeating my over-evaluation of Yankees shortstop Alexander Vargas here, but the possibility of two potentially elite carrying tools (and the early evidence we have that they'll manifest) has me excited enough to put Caba toward the back of the Top 100 list.",,"sa3021070"

I wrote Rodriguez up as a more of a utility guy when he was an amateur because he lacks the big-frame body projection typical of a star player, but now that he's accumulated a DSL season's worth of data, both his plate skills and contact ability are profile-driving attributes. We're talking 86% contact, 93% in-zone contact, and only 19% chase. DSL metrics like this are only so meaningful, but put on Rodriguez's tape and he <em>looks</em> like a really good hitter (he's been awesome in a small 2024 sample). He tracks pitches with bird-of-prey precision and makes flush, high-quality contact with a lovely and effortless left-handed swing. 
Rodriguez is also a good shortstop defender. His exchange on slow rollers in on the grass is sometimes clunky, but otherwise he can make the requisite shortstop plays, his hands and range are plus, and I think something closer to prototypical arm strength will arrive with physical maturity. This is not a monster-ceiling'd DSL prospect — Rodriguez is more in the Brayan Rocchio-ish, high-probability bucket. Once again, using recent draft prospects as a way to triangulate more correct list placement for DSL guys would slot Rodriguez behind the Marcelo Mayer and Jordan Lawlars of the world, and closer to the Colt Emerson/Jett Williams tier of player who often belong in the 10-15 range of a draft board.",,"sa3021101"

Roby looks like he spent the offseason improving his conditioning, but his delivery is still quite violent and tough to repeat. Mechanical violence and inconsistency lead to a relief projection here, but Roby has never shown elevated walk rates for an extended period of time as a starter; the relief forecast is entirely due to visual evaluation and projection.

Morales began his A's career in the DSL, but he was so dominant that he was sent to Arizona after just four outings. He didn't spend long there, nor in Stockton, and ended the 2023 season at High-A Lansing having pitched across four different levels. In total, Morales threw 44 innings, surrendered just 49 baserunners, and struck out 53. He began 2024 in extended spring training with a shoulder impingement before he was sent out at the very end of April. The linked video of Morales shows one of his extended outings. He looks the same as he did in 2023, which is equal parts encouraging (because he's coming off a shoulder issue) and disappointing (because he's still more a thrower than pitcher). 
The raw material Morales brings to the table is exceptional. He has an ideal pitcher's frame: a broad-shouldered 6-foot-3, tapered at the waist, with oodles of physical projection like a young Zack Wheeler. His arm speed looks like it should break the sound barrier and produces easy upper-90s cheese. Morales also has a hellacious two-plane curveball in the 81-84 mph range, and you can go wild projecting on his changeup because of his athleticism and arm speed. 
But Morales' pitchability and on-mound poise need to improve. He works at a breakneck pace that often feels counter productive. He gets the sign from his catcher and lets it rip, doesn't seem to be executing any kind of plan or competent sequencing, and his command is pretty scattered. In his last start prior to list publication, there was an awkward exchange when, during a third inning mound visit, Morales held the baseball out to pitching coach Don Schulze as if Schulze (who, again, is the pitching coach) was there to remove him. Instead, Schulze said something to Morales, who nodded; Schulze gave him an attaboy pat on the shoulder before returning to the dugout. Three pitches later Morales was removed in the middle of the at-bat, seemingly because of his pitch count, which he appeared confused and surprised by. It was a bizarre exchange emblematic of Morales' somewhat spacey on-field presence. He and the A's have plenty of time to develop his feel for these things, as his 40-man timeline doesn't start until after the 2026 season. 
Morales has this grade and Top 100 ranking because of his upside, which is considerable. He looks and moves like a top-of-the-rotation starter, and his stuff gives him a late-inning relief floor if he only barely develops as a strike-thrower. Were he a college prospect, Morales would be a top five pick (give or take) in most drafts because of his raw ability. Oakland's track record of optimizing pitchers isn't the best, but scouting and predicting aren't the same thing. Morales isn't racing to the big leagues and is definitely more of a Las Vegas A's prospect than an Oakland A's prospect, one who will probably spend most of the next three years trying to grow and improve as a craftsman.","bg6EuHqi1fM","sa3021487"

His curveball looked like it had gotten better during his draft spring, then his elbow blew out and he needed Tommy John, which precipitated his fall in the draft. Lesko was already the consensus top high school pitcher in the draft before the curveball showed up and would have been a lock for the top 10 had he stayed healthy throughout the spring, but instead he fell to no. 15, where he was picked by San Diego. Lesko looked incredible when he first returned to the mound in 2023, sitting comfortably in the mid-90s with explosive vertical movement across an inning or two of complex duty in Peoria. He ended up pitching 33 innings, ending the year with a few walk-prone starts at High-A Fort Wayne. Those walk-prone starts were a harbinger of things to come in 2024, as Lesko has struggled very badly with free passes. His command as well as his mechanical consistency and ease waver as he gets deeper into games, and he's walking 16% of opponents. 
When Lesko was written up on the offseason Top 100, it was hoped that this might be remedied simply through reps as Lesko matures and gets further away from TJ. That hasn't happened yet, but it's too early to panic about his strike throwing. What could prove harder to solve is that Lesko might have The Lucas Giolito Curveball Problem, which is to say that while his fastball tends to have downhill trajectory, his huge, mid-70s curveball does not. It pops up out of his hand on release and, at 20 mph slower than his fastball, is easy to identify. It was only chased at a 15% rate in 2023, per Synergy Sports; the big league chase rate on any given pitch in 2023 was 29%. It's a sexy-looking 73-77 mph curveball with big depth, and it will have strike-getting utility, but that may be it. He also has a slider, but that pitch isn't great from a stuff standpoint. We don't want to undersell Lesko's changeup, which is also pretty slow, sitting 79-82 mph, approximately 15 mph slower than his fastball. It has ridiculous screwball action and Lesko makes frequent, non-traditional use of it as an in-zone weapon. 
There's still huge upside here, but if there's a truly discouraging aspect to Lesko's 2024, it's that his first attempt at incorporating a slider is not going well. The command stuff isn't great, but it could be a short-term issue (definitely hurting the weight he'd carry in a trade this month) and isn't necessarily a long-term one. Even if it is, we're talking about a guy with an 80-grade pitch and huge velo, which will probably play at the back of a bullpen.",,"sa3020677"

Just before the COVID shutdown, Hurt shoved against TCU (6 IP, 9 K, 1 BB, 1 R) at a heavily attended tournament in LA, touching 95 mph several times. It was the best he ever looked at Southern Cal and he might have dramatically improved his draft stock had he pitched the whole spring. The Marlins drafted him, then later traded him and Alex Vesia to the Dodgers for Dylan Floro. Hurt spent most of 2021 on the shelf and only pitched about 20 innings during the regular season before he looked nasty — 94-97 mph with natural cut and a plus changeup — in the Arizona Fall League. 
Over the last two seasons, Hurt has built his innings count to 100 frames while retaining the velo spike, his tailing changeup has continued to improve to the point where it's now one of the best in the minors, and he's improved his ability to land both of his breaking balls for strikes. Hurt's 19.7% swinging strike rate was the highest in the 2023 minor leagues among pitchers who threw at least 80 innings. He's a heavier guy with a high-effort delivery, definitely a look you see in the bullpen more often than in the rotation, and Hurt's fastball command is not good. There's a lot of relief risk here, but we're buying that the combo of Hurt's feel for spotting his breakers and his changeup's ability to bail him out of any count will allow him to start. Hurt has only tended to work between 3-5 innings at a time. He's an inefficient operator and will probably be a five-and-dive type of starter with elevated peripherals. He's on the 40-man roster and got a two-inning cup of coffee in the majors last September. He might be on an innings count that pushes him into the big league bullpen toward the end of his rookie year.",,"27514"

He was shut down after the 2022 draft and debuted during 2023 big league spring training with much more velocity than he had previously shown, which he proceeded to maintain across 106.2 innings this season. Hampton blew away Sally League hitters (40.5% K%) in the first half of the year before he seemed to lose his legs a little bit in a second half spent at Double-A Somerset. His line to the plate became less consistent, the timing of his fairly long arm stroke wavered, and he had some walk-prone starts in the mid-to-late summer. It's still pretty amazing that Hampton was able to sit 93-96 for much of the season (more 92-95 late) as he basically doubled his previous career innings high. 
Hampton's arm action is pretty reliever-y and long, but because of the way his fastball plays, he doesn't have to have pinpoint command in order to remain a starter. His well-located fastballs work uphill with plus riding life, and Hampton is competent enough at peppering the top half of the zone with the pitch to project as a starter. The heater is one of a troika of offerings Hampton has to miss bats, along with a 12-to-6 hammer curveball and a mid-80s two-plane slider. He'll be able to get ahead of hitters the second and third time through the order with his curveball and cutter, and then finish guys with high fastballs. 
I suppose there's still some amount of risk here, as Hampton has only really thrown consistent strikes for two months of his collegiate and minor league career. It's possible he ends up on a trajectory like Clarke Schmidt's, where it takes him a while to establish himself as a part of the rotation, but I think the way Hampton's fastball plays will mask some of his imprecision. He projects as a contender's mid-rotation starter and he could debut in mid-to-late 2024.",,"sa3020682"

Melendez. Some of the underlying hit tool issues that Cartaya performed in spite of during previous seasons became untenable in 2023, as upper-level opposing pitchers executed to the locations he struggles to cover, which are copious. This is nothing new — Cartaya has had elevated strikeout rates in the lower minors (26% or more) since 2021, and hit tool risk has been a part of his profile the entire time. It will continue to be, but if Cartaya can get to enough of his power and continue to develop on defense (more on that in a second), then he's still likely to clear the low offensive bar at catcher. The physical punishment inherent in catchers' duties can have a pretty serious impact on how they perform on offense for long stretches of time. Cartaya's bat looked unusually slow in 2023 and his max exit velocity declined three ticks from the previous season; his issues were not as simple as him having a low BABIP (although he did at .216). The exit velo decline could point to some underlying malady, or at least is an indication that Cartaya wasn't in peak physical form last year. He had multiple injury issues in prior seasons (mostly back and hamstring). At age 22, it's fair to conclude that he's not in physical decline, and that whatever his 2023 issue, it might be remedied or healed with an offseason of rest. If anything, broad-shouldered, 22-year-old hitters who are built like castle drawbridges, as Cartaya is, tend to merit more projection into their mid-20s. 
Cartaya still has developing to do on defense, but he's a pretty good bet to remain a catcher. His receiving and ball-blocking are still below average (common for a 22-year-old, but it's frustrating that Cartaya has been treading water in this regard), and too often he fumbles the baseball during his exchange, but his raw arm strength is very good and he has the big, durable frame typical of a primary catcher. 
He is no longer on the expressway to Chavez Ravine like it seemed he was a year ago, but Cartaya is still a high-ceiling catching prospect who stands a chance to be an impact regular. One of Cartaya's option years has now passed. Will Smith is entrenched ahead of him, and fellow catching prospects Dalton Rushing and Thayron Liranzo put themselves in the medium-term 40-man mix with great 2023 seasons. It's very important for Cartaya to rebound in 2024 so he can enter his final option year as a viable big league option. You could point to any of the Dodgers' good catching prospects as candidates for trade, and Smith's presence increases the likelihood that any of them begins their career as a backup, which is especially true for Cartaya because he's already on the 40-man roster. We're not totally ignoring Cartaya's 2023 flop, but our instincts here are to avoid overcorrection and continue to project Cartaya as a long-term primary catcher.","c-LTwTIlv7s","sa3008742"

Amador is one of those compact switch-hitters who is so short to the ball that he gets an extra beat to diagnose pitches before he has to commit to swinging, and he takes advantage of this. He's walked more than he's struck out every year of his pro career, and ran a microscopic 5% swinging strike rate in 2023. Over the past two years, Amador has thickened like a roux and become stronger, but he still doesn't have great power. At least some of that lack of thump in 2023 was likely due to the after effects of a mid-season hamate break, but Amador is still much better at spoiling pitches than he is at actually squaring them up. He can move the barrel all over the place but his swing isn't often well-connected in a way that allows him to punish the baseball. Now that he's close to physically maxed out, any leap he takes in the power department will need to come from improving his feel for loft, and it's much more likely that Amador will hit dozens of doubles at maturity than lots of homers. 
While he's on the 40-man roster, Amador is still probably a couple of years away from finding his big league footing. He lacks some field awareness (he bat-flipped a walk down six or seven runs last week against Bowie) and Double-A looks fast for him in the early going of 2024, but he only turned 21 at the very start of the season and has just one totally healthy year of reps at a full-season affiliate under his belt. The bat control savants who play second base need to hit for power to truly be a star; the Joe Panik/Adam Frazier types who Amador perhaps comps to tend to pan out like 50-grade players over a long period of time. I considered altering Amador's grade and sliding him within the Top 100, but because of the context here (Amador's age and relative inexperience, he's coming off injury, it's freezing cold in Hartford in early April), I want to let things air out and give him time to adjust to the Eastern League before doing so.","WXd_Jl3PBO0","27962"

The eighth overall pick in 2023 out of a Texas high school, Mitchell only totaled 52 pro plate appearances in his draft year, but he did walk more than he struck out (17 BB/14 K). He is striking out a concerning 31% of the time so far in 2024, with more swings-and-misses than balls in play on his ledger. That's something of a red flag, but Mitchell is otherwise a pretty complete talent who just needs polish. 
Mitchell has a super strong, medium frame, and while it doesn't ooze projectability, he also isn’t obviously done maturing. He has a rhythmic, loose operation in the batter's box, his bat path is conducive to elevating with authority, and he rotates very well. Mitchell also looks to have feel for the strike zone, chasing less than 20% of the time. The power and on-base aspects of his profile are going to be enough for Mitchell to be a big league catcher. The question is whether his hit tool causes him to have a Joey Bart/Mike Zunino-esque early-career roller coaster, or he ends up getting to so much power that it doesn't matter. 
Mitchell utilizes his athleticism behind the plate as a defender too, receiving from a spread out, one-knee stance that enables him to do an especially effective job at snatching borderline pitches at the bottom of the zone with his bottom-up approach. As much as his wide, one-knee setup assists him in stealing lower-quadrant strikes, it does hinder his ability to throw out baserunners. He has plus-plus arm strength, but he’s throwing out less than 20% of would-be thieves this season because he's slow to get out of his low crouch and has a lengthy arm circle that causes him to produce closer to average pop times. Mitchell has the talent to be an impact everyday catcher, and the strength in his hands is on a much different level than most of his peers, something that has basically been true since he was a high school sophomore. He's flawed and risky, but he has tremendous upside.",,"sa3022756"

His delivery is also a more controlled, repeatable operation than it was in his prep days. He has a compact arm circle with a quick, clean path before he releases from a high three-quarters slot. Kudrna utilizes both a four-seam fastball and a sinker that sit 91-95 mph and have touched as high as 97 mph this year. The sinker shows average tail and sinking action, while the four-seamer has solid carry in the upper quadrants of the zone. His 83-86 mph slider is a two-plane breaker with late action. On occasion it will turn into more of a vertical downer, with both shapes capable of producing above-average teeth. Kudrna's changeup (85-88 mph) offers limited velocity separation from his fastball, but he throws it with the same arm speed (his delivery's late acceleration helps too), while flashing effective fade and depth on his better ones. It's a pitch that varies in its quality at present, but it has already taken a big leap in his brief time as a pro, and with the quality of his arm action, it should continue to evolve into at least an average weapon for him. With a career walk rate around 10% across his 245.2 frames in the Royals system, Kudrna projects to be an average control/fringe-average command type who is tracking towards a no. 4/5 starter role.",,"sa3018253"

ZiPS still likes Schanuel to produce as a 45-grade player for the next three years, right in line with our preseason report and evaluation, which we stand by. It is reproduced here: If you liked Craig Counsell's batting stance, then please enjoy Schanuel, whose hands start way above his head before they load in a pretty normal spot. It's common for hitters in college baseball to walk as much as they strike out, especially the good ones. Schanuel walked <em>five times</em> as often as he struck out in 2023, a cartoonish stat that helps illuminate his freaky feel to hit. Even as a small school prospect, he was viewed as one of the more advanced bats in the 2023 draft class, and the Angels, who tended to take players of that ilk during the late-Ohtani era, made Schanuel their first round pick and had him in the big leagues before the end of the season. 
Schanuel's swing isn't sexy or explosive, he just finds a way to put the bat on the ball, and the natural uphill path of his cut helps him to hit for some power, though the reason Schanuel was left off the offseason Top 100 was because he doesn't project to hit for enough thump to be a meaningfully impactful first baseman during the next half decade or so. He slugged .868 in college last year, but it was more due to his consistency of contact than big power, and Schanuel has way less raw pop than is typical of a first baseman. As part of an offseason regimen to try to get stronger, Schanuel stood all day. He perhaps looks a little bit stronger this spring, but he's probably going to be more of a player you can ""win with"" in your lineup than one you win ""because of,"" akin to LaMonte Wade Jr. and other contact-oriented first basemen of modest impact.",,"33189"

Petty is an incredible on-mound athlete whose body whips around like a tornado throughout his delivery, which compares to Abner Uribe's. He was up to 102 mph and routinely sat in the mid-to-upper 90s during his draft year, then has ""only"" averaged 94 mph each of the last couple of seasons while working four innings per outing to a max of 98 innings in 2022. Petty missed the first month of 2023 with an elbow issue but looked like his usual self when he returned, and during the spring of 2024 he's had a velo spike back into the 95-99 mph range even as he's stretched out from just one or two innings to four as camp broke. 
Petty has built an impressive and pleasantly surprising multi-year track record of strike-throwing, capped by a fantastic 5.8% BB% in 2023. His early 2024 look, to the eye, has been more reliever-y, and it's possible that in order to get to his peak velocity again, he has to throw with such effort that it detracts from his strike-throwing. Petty's fastball doesn't really miss bats even at this velocity because it's more of a sinker, but it does help Petty get a lot of groundballs (58.5% GB% at High-A last year). This spring, Petty looks like he's added a second breaking ball. In 2023, he was working with a mid-80s slider in the 83-89 mph range that typically had two-plane shape. So far in 2024, he has a low-90s cutter and a mid-80s slurve, which have distinct shape from one another. One doesn't typically project heavily on a changeup when the pitcher's arm action is as long as Petty's, but he flashes a good one once in a while, too. Among the many keys for Petty's 2024 are maintaining this sudden velo surge while also continuing to throw strikes, and finding a second bat-missing pitch to go with his excellent slower breaking ball. If he can do even one of those, he'll move into the Top 100 and be poised for a 2025 debut ahead of his chalk 40-man clock.",,"sa3017963"

Chourio has a terrific offensive skill set that includes at least a little bit of all three core skills: contact, power, and plate discipline. He has feel for making in-swing adjustments to his posture in the hips and back to alter the location of his barrel, and he's already strong enough to do damage on some of his awkward looking swings. The square-framed switch-hitter has room for more strength and (hopefully) raw power, which should allow him to profile as an everyday left fielder, Chourio's most likely future defensive home. How much power he develops will dictate whether Chourio becomes a Robbie Grossman type of big leaguer, or makes a leap into the Ian Happ/Shin-Soo Choo level of impact. Because we're talking about a corner defender, I want to see the power manifest more in games than it has so far (two home runs in two seasons) before valuing Chourio's profile in the Top 100 range, but it looks like we're about to get that.","Mx9VvslaGaM","sa3018399"

Head signed for $2.8 million as a toolsy high school outfielder with plus-plus speed and a chance to grow into plus power, though more through sheer explosiveness than standard, frame-based projection. After the draft, Head's performance at Low-A Lake Elsinore was strong enough to push for (but not quite make) a spot on the Top 100 list. Cold weather prep hitters like Head (who's from Chicago) can be risky hit tool propositions, but Head's 82% zone contact and 92% overall contact rate across 124 PA not only reinforced the notion that he was going to hit, but would perhaps do so even more than anticipated. He was an offseason Pick to Click and was traded to the Marlins as the headline prospect in the Luis Arraez deal. 
So far in 2024, however, Head has been swinging and missing much more than he did in 2023; his contact rate is closer to 65% and he has about as many whiffs as he does balls in play. Backfoot breaking balls have been especially thorny for him to adjust to. This isn't necessarily concerning, it's just an indication Head isn't making ""the leap"" just yet. He has dealt with recurring abductor strains since joining the Marlins system and began rehabbing on the Complex just before list publication. 
Head is also still developing in center field, where he easily has the pure speed to be an impact defender but doesn't look totally comfortable right now. One of these things — either his center field defense or his hit tool — probably needs to become plus for Head to be an impact, everyday guy in Miami. If his hit tool progresses, then Head will also be getting to his power, which is quite precocious for a teenage center field prospect. Head has homer power to his pull side and doubles pop to the oppo gap, and his feel for lifting the baseball to both sides of the diamond is natural and exciting. He was awesome for a month of pro ball last year, then not awesome for the first month of 2024, but he still has impact tools and the subjective background traits (cold weather guy, high-end athlete, the amateur side of the industry loved his makeup coming out) that would make you want to project on the hit tool and feel for defense.

While aspects of his swing make him vulnerable to breaking balls on the outer third, Nimmala is able to create big power in a relatively short distance, and his swing isn't overly noisy or hard to maintain. He has a tendency to pull off of stuff bending away from him and struck out much more than expected during his senior spring, enough that he slid from near the top of Eric's draft rankings to the back of the first round based on his spring look. After the draft, Arjun had trouble picking up breaking balls in pro ball. There are past examples of players who were suddenly K-prone as seniors and had things still work out (Nolan Gorman), while there are others for whom the strikeouts proved to be a meaningful signal (Keoni Cavaco). At his size, Nimmala is more likely to end up at third base than he is to stay at shortstop, which means he has very little hit tool margin for error. The skill foundation here is still very exciting, though. Nimmala's age and power combination is incredibly rare, and his upside hasn't changed, but as time has drawn on, the perception about his likelihood to reach it has.

My fear here is that Fernandez doesn't even have to be tricked in order to be beaten — you can also beat him executing fastballs up and away from him in the zone because his swing is so geared for low-ball contact that he can't get on top of them. This is where a gap between someone like Heston Kjerstad (who also chases a lot, but is a power threat all over the zone) and Yanquiel comes from in terms of evaluation. I think there has to be adjustment here in order for Fernandez to succeed, but he's young enough that there feasibly could be. His best swings are, I'm not kidding, Griffey-like in their explosion and beautiful finish. The power-hitting potential here is so strong that I think Fernandez will find a way to produce like a corner platoon guy despite his flaws, and if he can improve on those as he gets deep into his 20s, he'll have a monstrous peak. This is a pretty volatile player who the Rockies should be patient with, as he's likely to have some pretty severe early-career struggles against big league arms.","z7sjzxNWWio","sa3015648"

This season, he's back in Quad Cities, where his offensive output has taken an encouraging turn, as he’s currently sporting an OPS above .800. This is a fairly extreme Three True Outcomes type of profile. Jensen’s 17% career walk rate is a product of both his strike zone awareness and a passive streak in his approach. His lofty path and the aggressive intent in his hacks ensure Jensen will get to power when he's making contact. 
Jensen's defensive ability as a catcher is the aspect of his game that has progressed the most from his days as an amateur. His frame is leaner and more athletic than it was when he was a high school prospect in Kansas City’s backyard, and shedding some of his bulk has improved his ability as a lateral mover, enabling him to better block balls in the dirt. His receiving continues to trend in the right direction and it’s looking more likely than not that he'll be an average or better defensive backstop in the future.

He has a strong, broad-shouldered build, comes at hitters from a high three-quarters slot, and has above-average arm speed. 
Dana’s upright posture and 6-foot-4 height create a downhill angle on his fastball, which could make his heater velo-reliant as he climbs the minors. This tends to be a trait that indicates relief risk. Dana’s fastball sits 92-95 mph and will touch 96 while showing fair carry and late run. His delivery looks starter-y in terms of effort, and he’s shown improved feel for repeating it. The slider is the most consistent secondary pitch in Dana’s mix; it features both vertical and horizontal break, and will morph into a downer version on occasion. There’s advanced feel for locating the pitch down and away to right-handed hitters, but not yet to other quadrants. It looks like a plus pitch from a visual scouting standpoint and it's even better than that when it comes to things like its chase and whiff rates, though from a stuff quantification POV, it's only a bit above average. Dana has another distinct breaker in his curveball, which has 12-to-6 shape and significant depth, but it doesn't show above-average break with the frequency his slider does. Dana’s changeup continues to lag behind development-wise; it ranges between 84-88 mph and it often lacks the action that would allow it to miss bats or generate weak contact. 
Dana has the build and (for the most part) mechanical look of a innings-eating workhorse, but his command and pitch mix are more typical of a reliever. The good news is that if the latter is true, his slider quality will probably facilitate a late-inning role.",,"31508"

He covered three levels in 2023 and finished at Triple-A Sugar Land, posting a cumulative OPS of .880 with 25 homers and 27 steals in 31 attempts. In 2024, he hit 10 homers in the first half of April, made his big league debut, and has been up and down depending on the health of Houston's other outfielders. 
Loperfido hits out of a crouched, square stance with his hands set up high, and has a direct, adjustable path that sprays contact to all-fields. He can really elevate pitches with authority in the lower quadrants of the zone and hits the ball hard with meaningful consistency. He swings through a lot of in-zone fastballs and is striking out about 30% of the time at Triple-A. A lack of consistent contact is what stands between Loperfido and an everyday grade. 
A big part of why we're this high on him despite his hit tool issues is Loperfido's very versatile defensive profile. He has the ability to play all three outfield positions at an average level, while also showing he can handle first and second-base at a passable level. The way Loperfido can move the ball around the infield at first base is actually quite special. While he does many things at an average to solid level, there’s no single aspect of his bat or defensive ability that grades out as plus; this is a profile where the sum is greater than the raw parts.

He was not viewed as a slam dunk to stay at catcher in part because of his size, but nearly top-of-the-scale power and arm strength drove a profile of monster upside. Duno hit a robust .303/.451/.493 in the 2023 DSL but he didn't catch, DHing all summer instead (and playing first base in the DSL All-Star Game) due to an elbow injury. This spring on the Goodyear complex, Duno stood apart from most of his peers in terms of size and strength, and looks at home among big leaguers who are a decade or so older than he is. He takes a ridiculous BP for an 18-year-old, the kind where you can feel the thump of him compressing the baseball deep in your chest, as if you were standing next to a bass drum at a concert. The level of explosion and bat speed for an athlete of Duno's size is remarkable, and he already has enormous measureable raw power for a player his age. He was obviously bigger than Chase DeLauter (listed at 6-foot-4, 235 pounds) when the two stood next to one another. 
Duno is still incredibly raw, most notably as a catcher, where the speed of the game is too much for him right now. He had multiple pitch timer violations in the Reds' Spring Breakout game, for instance. None of this is unusual for a teenage backstop, let alone one who probably caught less pro-quality stuff than most high-profile domestic amateurs. To put this in a different context, it's as if Duno is a high school senior who didn't catch as a junior, and now rather than now catch fellow high school seniors, he's catching domestic A-ball arms. His profile is similar to other high-risk/high-upside teenage catchers like Blake Mitchell and Eduardo Tait (both 45 FV prospects), but Duno has a different level of physical ability than those two guys. Of players who could take a leap from outside the Top 100 to being among the top 30 or so prospects in baseball during the next 18 months, Duno is a clear candidate because of his power potential at the catching position. I want to see how his strikeouts trend during the season and revisit his defense on tape (it's not good right now) later in the year before stuffing this guy in the no. 30-50 overall range in baseball, but that's how things are trending here.","NQiYjLFs01A","sa3021066"

His arm accuracy, which is very inconsistent, is the biggest defensive shortcoming he needs to remedy, but he's talented and athletic enough to continue developing at shortstop to see if he can. 
On offense, Genao's contact performance is exciting for such a young switch-hitter. He's still figuring out how to pull the ball as a left-handed hitter, but he's fairly short to the baseball and has precocious bat control. He also swings with exciting verve from both sides of the plate and looks like he has room for 15-20 more pounds of muscle before he starts to slow down. He could have the offensive package to profile at a corner position if it turns out he can't play shortstop. There are scouts who dare to dream that all the aspects of Genao's skill set will come together as hoped and that he'll become a build-around, everyday shortstop. That outcome is definitely in play, but it's a bit too out of focus to <em>value</em> Genao's prospectdom at that level already.

Leading up to the 2023 draft, White looked more muscular and mature in the body and held mid-90s velocity throughout the spring, albeit under a very conservative workload. The Marlins gave him just over $4 million as one of two first-round prep arms taken last year, the second straight draft where Miami coaxed a high school pitcher away from Vanderbilt. 
White's stuff was simply too good for Low-A and he was promoted to High-A Beloit after just eight 2024 starts. He's sitting 94-96 with roughly average life, which is more than enough to pave over Florida State League hitters. White also has a plus low-80s slider that bites very late and darts to his glove side. It looks like it has more lateral sweep to it now than it did in high school. The components of White's delivery are often ill-timed; his arm stroke tends to be a little late and White had scattershot command as a high schooler. The way his fastball plays gives him some margin for error in this regard, but despite a fairly encouraging walk rate so far as a pro, to the eye these issues haven't been remedied. This impacts White's secondary pitch consistency, especially that of his changeup. It will probably be a while before White is challenged and forced to sharpen his command.

If Goodman can improve enough as a defender to be a viable big league catcher (not even a good one, just passable), then he's going to be a primary backstop for as long as he can remain so. 
Goodman's power is sensational. He takes epic, max-effort swings and is capable of putting balls out to all fields. This style of hitting leads to lots of swing-and-miss, enough that if he were only an outfielder and first baseman, then we're talking about him more like Matt Davidson instead of Mike Napoli redux. Goodman's best throws produce plus pop times, but he doesn't handle the baseball especially skillfully and his throws are often ruined by inaccuracy or a fumbled exchange. He's still not a very good receiver but he looks a bit better this spring, and he's a gung-ho ball blocker who throws himself around in order to smother the baseball. 
A couple of list-making details that helped inform the way Goodman stacks here: He has a better chance of actually playing a premium position than the younger, seemingly more famous prospects in this system like Jordan Beck and Sterlin Thompson. His contact rates have been slightly superior to Beck's, and Goodman is able to pull the ball with power on the regular whereas Beck's swing is longer and he pushes contact to the opposite field. Goodman has the upside that all but a few prospects in the Rockies system lack, and if you believe in the old adage that catchers tend to develop late, he still has some defensive growth coming and should compete for playing time at a host of different positions relatively soon.",,"29715"

He sat 94-97 all last year across about 100 innings of work, and he's parked in that range again at the start of 2024. 
Winn was a polished slider away from making the offseason Top 100 list. He has had success (but not been dominate) in the majors even though his repertoire is missing a great breaking ball. Winn instead more often deploys a four- and two-seam fastball and his devastating splitter, which is one of the nastier ones in pro ball. Winn's upper-80s slider is hard but lacks the biting movement of a great finishing pitch. Athletically, Winn is a little bit stiff and eyeball evaluations of his relatively violent delivery have tended to funnel him toward the bullpen, but at this point his strike-throwing track record is long enough to bet he's going to start as long as he can stay healthy under a slightly larger workload.

He pitched exclusively as a reliever at Notre Dame and walked well over a batter per inning there, at times so wild he was benched. The Reds moved him to the rotation in pro ball and dramatically altered Boyle's arm slot, which is now much more vertical. But Boyle still walked around eight batters per 9 IP during his time in the Reds system before he was traded to Oakland for lefty specialist Sam Moll at the 2023 deadline. He mostly pitched at Double-A in 2023 but broke 2024 camp with the big league club. 
Boyle will sit 96-97 and touch 100 as a starter, and will flash three plus breaking balls — a low-90s slider and an 80-85 mph curveball — which both have vicious movement. He is often nowhere close to the zone with any of them, and is probably going to lead the majors in walks in 2024, but his size and flexibility are both typical of a big league starter. It makes a ton of sense for the A's to let Boyle try to start for as long as possible. The opportunity costs are relatively low, and a long-term attempt gives them the best shot at capturing Boyle's peak upside down the road by dealing with his horrendous strike throwing now. Big pitchers who throw really hard tend to develop a little later, and so even though the A's haven't typically been great at developing arms lately, Boyle's shot to become a starter is arguably greater in Oakland/Vegas than other places where he would have already been put in the bullpen.

Toronto didn't accelerate his promotion schedule to make up for the lost time, so he began 2021 back at Low-A as a 21-year-old and (mostly) flew under the FanGraphs prospect radar as an old-for-the-level player until 2022, when Barger hammered High- and Double-A pitching as a 22-year-old. Barger dealt with an elbow issue in 2023 and was limited to just shy of 90 games, and he didn't perform quite as well as in 2022. Still, by the end of the year, we were confident he felt no ill effects from the elbow because Barger's superhuman arm strength and cacophonous swing were both intact. His hack is a spectacle, lots of fun when he's on time and frustrating when he's late, utilizing a narrow, open stance and a huge leg kick. Barger can really cut it loose and is a threat to do damage on every swing, but his style is going to lead to plenty of strikeouts. 
Barger's defensive forecast has slid down the spectrum a bit, and we now think he'll play a combination of 3B and RF rather than the middle infield (which he still played some of in 2023). We think he'll be fine (but not great) at third and are excited about his potential defensive impact in right field because of his arm (which also hides some of his infield ills). We project that Barger will get to enough power to be the larger half of a 3B/RF platoon, and given Toronto's need for lefty bats and the departure of Matt Chapman, 2024 feels like his year to debut and contribute.","pe7-JHCsX2Q","24598"

The twitchy, rangy shortstop has a lean, projectable frame and already swings pretty hard. Hernandez hits out of a slightly open stance with a high-hands setup before utilizing a leg kick trigger to bring him back to square. There’s average bat speed here right now, but Hernandez does tend to get lengthy in his path, resulting in too much weak groundball contact, as reflected in Hernandez’s 48% groundball rate from 2023. While he projects to have average raw, barring an adjustment, Hernandez’s inability to keep the ball off the ground will make his solid-average hit tool play a little lighter than most. 
Hernandez has played all over the infield defensively and has progressed significantly with his glove, to the point he projects to be a solid-average defender anywhere on the dirt. He's acrobatic but his hands are a little inconsistent. The range and athleticism to play shortstop are clearly here, and the other stuff should get polished as Hernandez gets stronger and more experienced.

He'd perhaps be more valuable to another club where he'd more often be needed on left side of the infield. Michael Massey's frequent platoon advantage adds to this notion. But real contenders often have players occupying roles below their talent, and that's exactly what's happening here. 
From his report: Loftin's bat-to-ball ability is meaningfully good, enough to consider him a solid role player even though he lacks the power typical of a guy profiling at the positions he can play well. We're talking an 88% in-zone contact rate and 80% contact rate overall, both plus on the big league scale. His plate coverage is fantastic, especially at the top of the strike zone, where he can tomahawk extra-base contact to his pull side. Loftin still has developing to do at first base, where his footwork and hands aren't yet polished, but he's fine at second and third base.

He stands in at a strapping at 6-foot-4 and has pretty clearly been in the weight room since he signed. He doesn't have an uber-projectable frame, but Kent has already gotten stronger and isn't fully grown. 
Kent’s fastball currently sits between 91-95 mph, and he’s shown he’s capable of reaching back for a couple extra ticks of velocity in the past. There’s some looseness in his arm action, and as his frame continues to mature, it’s easy to see his average fastball velocity also ticking up. Presently, Kent’s fastball shows solid carry when he’s working above the belt but a vulnerable lack of movement in the zone; his heater is going to depend on his command in order to play. His slider will show traditional two-plane shape as well as a more vertical downer version, both of which are capable of flashing above-average bite. Kent's prototypical size and natural slider movement are the driving forces of his profile. He needs to polish his changeup. Right now, Kent does a good job of maintaining his fastball arm speed when throwing his cambio, but the majority of the time it’s an offering that lacks notable action. The change will show both fade and depth on occasion, but it will need to do so with much greater frequency if it’s ever going to be an average pitch for him. 
Kent's realistic ceiling (via a leap in changeup quality and command) is that of a backend starter. He's a pretty standard million-dollar teenage pitching prospect, albeit one who we'd view toward the bottom third of that player group because of his fastball shape and lack of command. Before the draft, Kent's build was also part of why he was more clearly a 40 FV prospect than a 40+, and he's already made strides in that area. If those improvements lead to better command, and Kent shows us that across a bigger performance sample in 2024, he'll move up the FV continuum.",,"sa3023082"

While on the surface it seems like Taylor's early-season swoon was a blip, he did have some swing-and-miss issues exposed in 2023. He is extremely pull-oriented and his hips tend to bail toward first base, creating a hole on the outer third of the zone. Taylor's swing is also geared for lift in the extreme, which creates a different hole at the top of the strike zone. But Taylor is so selective and so reliably hits the ball in the air when he does make contact that he's gotten to big game power since turning pro. Taylor doesn't have .500 SLG raw power; his measured exit velocities are south of the big league average. There are definitely core competencies in Taylor's offense but not big tools. 
Instead, his best skill is his defense. The Rays have tried to move Taylor up the defensive spectrum and are giving him a ton of reps at shortstop rather than his native third base. It just might work. His hands and actions are certainly of shortstop quality, and if it turns out Taylor doesn't have quite enough arm (at times his stroke looks deliberately short and odd) or range to stay there, then he's going to be a plus-plus third base defender. Does all of this add up to an everyday player despite the middling raw power and below-average hit tool? There's some precedent for it. For instance, Paul DeJong and later-career Matt Carpenter presented a similar profile at times, while Ryan Schimpf's career arc feels like the floor here, except with much better defense stabilizing Taylor's profile. We're not ready to stuff Taylor inside the Top 100 just yet because his profile is so bizarre.

The emergence of a consistently above-average third offering (a good changeup) reignited Burrows' projection as a starter (he had been projected as a fastball/curveball reliever here in previous seasons, in part due to injuries), and across his 94.1 innings in 2022, he racked up 111 strikeouts against just 31 walks. Burrows then had Tommy John at the very start of the 2023 campaign. He returned for his first game action in about 14 months two days before list publication. His fastball sat 94-95 with 16-17 inches of vertical break. His trademark changeup looked like its usual nasty self, sinking in with power action at 86-88 mph. Burrows' change induced a 53% miss rate in 2022 and his usage of it skyrocketed. Primarily a curveball-oriented guy before his injury, Burrows showed a new, harder slider in his 2024 debut, as well as his usual low-80s curve. 
Burrows is on the 40-man and in his second option year. Given his injury history, it's fair to say that he has substantial relief risk, but the addition of a fourth pitch makes it seem like Pittsburgh is staying the course with him coming out of rehab and will continue to develop Burrows as a starter. His command looks predictably rusty after the layoff and will need to rebound for that to occur, but Burrows has the pitch mix to be a good team's no. 4 starter if indeed he can stay healthy and throw strikes like he did in 2022.",,"24728"

At the end of the season, it felt very likely that Santana would develop immense arm strength as he matured. He has so much room for mass on his frame and his arm action is so clean and fluid — this seemed like the type of pitcher who could end up throwing 100 one day. All of that was projection, of course, based purely on visual assessment. In his first DSL start of 2024, Santana sat 93-98, debuted a slider/cutter in the 88-90 mph range and was working with a 91-94 mph changeup.

His curveball is a knee-buckling parabola of death, he's adept at creating tail on his changeup, and his general athleticism and the looseness of his arm action portend continued growth in this area. His fastball's shape doesn't really complement his curveball right now, but Vargas is too young to really worry about that. The ease of his delivery and his ability to throw strikes both facilitate starter projection, and his extremely lanky, broad-shouldered build not only generates hope that he can maintain mid-90s heat under a starter's workload, but also that he may continue to throw harder as he matures.

His contact ability will probably trend down as he climbs the minors, but so far Wilken has had a successful post-draft debut, hitting .285/.414/.473 in 47 games.

The power and OBP components together are important because there's a chance Wilken ends up at first base. He has big raw arm strength, but his size and stiffness aren't a clean fit at third base in the big leagues, where he'll be measured against the Matt Chapmans and Nolan Arenados of the world. He'll need to work to stay as agile and mobile as possible to avoid a shift to first. For now, I have him projected as a 40-grade third sacker.

He had some first round buzz (probably under slot) and was heavy in the mix of model-driven teams because he was not yet 21 on draft day. Keaschall ended up signing for $1.5 million as a second-round pick, and his profile has changed and grown a lot since he's entered pro ball. 
The undersized Keaschall is a premium in-the-box athlete with a flexible and powerful lower body, as well as strong wrists that turn over through contact. At Arizona State he would often look a little out of control, chasing a ton and swinging so hard that he found himself off balance. This is one of the areas in which Keaschall has changed since joining Minnesota's system. His swing rate has dropped from 50% at ASU to 38% with the Twins, and he walked more than he struck out at High-A Cedar Rapids prior to a promotion to Double-A Wichita in late May. He doesn't have monster raw power, but Keaschall's swing brings consistent pull-side lift to the party, allowing him to get to the power he has; this is also aided by Keaschall's new approach, where he only targets pitches he can drive. It will be important to monitor how his on-base skills progress now that Keaschall has reached the upper minors, especially as the quality of the breaking stuff he faces improves. 
The other huge variable here is Keaschall's defense. A bad college middle infielder, Keaschall continued to look rough at second base with Cedar Rapids, DH'd for most of May, and came out the other side playing more center field and even some first base. His feel for center is predictably pretty rough, but it's noticeably better now than when he started playing there at the beginning of the season. He's an above-average runner but not blazingly fast, and so feel and instincts are going to be important for him to stick in center; the Twins may have an everyday center fielder on their hands if he can keep improving out there. You could argue Keaschall should be slotted behind Austin Martin on this list because they're similar players and Martin is big league ready, but the cement is dry on Martin where it isn't on Keaschall, who will be an offseason Top 100 prospect if he can solidify his defense in center field.",,"sa3022614"

With veterans Francisco Lindor and Jeff McNeil occupying the middle infield spots, Mauricio was likely going to battle Brett Baty and Mark Vientos for playing time at third base, which was his primary position with Licey before he was injured. The Mets began to play him all over the place in 2023 (including in left field) looking for pathways to playing time, as they were clogged at many positions and Mauricio was hitting well at Triple-A. He slashed .292/.346/.506 (a 108 wRC+, which gives you an idea of the run environment), and Mauricio had his third consecutive season with at least 20 homers, his second consecutive 20/20 campaign, and was fresh off winning the LIDOM MVP the winter before. 
Mauricio is a huge-framed switch-hitting shortstop with power from both sides of the plate and a rocket arm, but his swing decisions are often so reckless that even though he's met expectations since his high-profile signing, he's still an extremely volatile prospect. Because he's gotten stronger and added huge power while remaining just agile enough to play shortstop, his chase issues are palatable. Mauricio has historically had chase rates near 40% and has a career .311 OBP in the minors. His secondary pitch recognition isn't good, and he's very vulnerable to soft stuff in the bottom of the zone and below. There are some players who are as aggressive as Mauricio (or more so) who find a way to be impact big leaguers anyway, and almost all of them tend to make enough in-zone contact to buoy their overall offensive output. Ronny Mo is on the very edge of viability in this respect, with in-zone contact rates of 83-85% the last few seasons, which is right around what successful chase-prone, low-OBP hitters like Ozzie Albies and Jonathan Schoop have shown. 
Hopefully a year of relative inactivity doesn't impact Mauricio's defensive ability so much that he can't play shortstop anymore, as his capability there is an important aspect of his profile. A typical slash line for Mauricio projects like juiced ball-era Freddy Galvis: a low OBP with 25-30 homers and plus infield defense.","NvOA8y_cZGI","23698"

Hjerpe utilizes a big hip turn in his delivery that helps him shield hitters' sightline to the baseball. His crossfire stride direction and side-arm slot add to his funk. During the 2023 regular season, Hjerpe was limited to 41 innings with Peoria, where he fanned 29.8% of opposing batters but also carried an inflated 14.6% walk rate, before having surgery to repair a loose body in his left elbow. He was assigned to High-A again to start 2024 and continues to have a higher-than-anticipated walk rate. 
Hjerpe has a unique fastball due to the angle he creates in his delivery, and it plays well above its 89-91 mph radar gun readings. He consistently attacks right-handed hitters in the upper quadrants and generates an above-average amount of swing-and-miss doing so. The headliner here, though, is his slider, which ranges between 75-79 mph and has late, sharp tilt that is capable of slipping under bats. He also has a similarly shaped cutter that is firmer (83-86 mph) and lacks the tilt; it's an offering he uses more to stay off barrels than generate whiffs. Hjerpe also utilizes a changeup that has fade and a unique amount of depth for the low slot he throws from; he'll throw the pitch to hitters of either handedness. The biggest concern here is that the control issues that plagued Hjerpe's injury-shortened 2023 season have continued so far in 2024. His ability to remain a starter will hinge upon whether he’s able to regain the above-average feel for command he showed for much of his amateur career.","WgC5zur2rTo","sa3020736"

He slashed .248/.321/.427 as a 19-year-old and had his second straight season with double digit homers and triples. All told, Arroyo had 49 extra-base hits in 123 games. His ability to lift the baseball and consistently get to power is the foundation of a profile that has some cracks, cracks that kept Arroyo just off the Top 100 even before a torn labrum and subsequent surgery shelved him for all of 2024. 
For one, Arroyo's arm strength and the somewhat casual pace of his actions are better fits at second base than at shortstop, and even though Arroyo has really only played shortstop as a pro, he's projected to second base here. Second, Arroyo's rate of chase and inability to make contact with soft stuff that finishes in the bottom third of the strike zone will likely pull his OBP down below the typically accepted levels for an everyday player. Switch-hitting middle infielders who get to power like Arroyo does are still valuable, but in his case it will probably be in a second-division, everyday second base role. Arroyo has pole-to-pole power from the left side of the plate, scooping mistake breaking stuff to his pull side and spraying fastballs the other way. He's more of a pull-only hitter as a righty but he still lifts the ball consistently (note that I have Arroyo's game power projected above his raw because of how remarkable his feel for list is). This is going to weaponize Arroyo's power, which should be average or a tick above at maturity. It's good pop for a second baseman but not quite enough to elevate the entire profile, which is dragged down by a middling rate contact and poor OBP skills. He's still going to be a good player, just probably not a 2-plus annual WAR guy.","JbBRRfNrRaM","sa3017626"

He dealt with a 2023 elbow injury that was sandwiched between dominant stretches with a nearly 40% strikeout rate and 7% walk rate, capped by a great Fall League showing. Early in 2024, Salinas' walk rate has again been elevated, but I still believe in his athleticism and pitch utility enough to consider him a potential no. 4 starter. 
The physique of the barrel-chested Salinas (who looks a little more svelte early in 2024) belies his athleticism somewhat. He gets way down the mound and generates pretty ridiculous hip/shoulder separation for a huskier guy, but he doesn't demonstrate that athleticism in other keys ways, such as how he moves off the mound to play defense. He often looks imbalanced and not well-connected to the ground as he completes his delivery, which impacts his release consistency; some of his errant fastball control might be due to how much effort Salinas requires to get as far down the mound as he does. As a pretty athletic 23-year-old, this might still improve, and I think aspects of his repertoire will allow him to work more efficiently than he has to this point. 
For instance, Salinas could throw either of his excellent breaking balls for early-count strikes more often. Both of Royber's breakers (a late-moving 85-88 mph SOB slider and a low-80s rainbow curveball) have generated absurd miss rates north of 50% combined between 2023 and 2024, and have enough movement to play in the strike zone even when they're anticipated. Salinas also showed both four-seamer (sometimes with natural cut) and one-seam sinker fastball variants in the fall, and mixing those should help him generate weak early-count contact. I saw good changeups in the Fall League, but they've barely been part of Salinas' mix early in 2024. This guy is on the 40-man roster now and has a chance to debut this year if he can curb his walks. I'd greatly prefer Salinas to stay limber and loose rather than become tightly wound like some baseball athletes tend to as they drop weight. This visual detail is important to monitor if Salinas continues to slim, as it appears he recently has. A balanced and flexible lower body is integral to my command projection here.","6nDYveA9WjM","sa3009243"

Cecconi has a four-pitch mix, and all of his offerings are average or better. So far in 2024, his fastball has ranged between 92-95 mph and touched 98 mph with running action and a hint of carry when he works it up in the zone. It’s not surgical command, but it projects to be a tick above average and gives him a solid fastball grade overall. Cecconi’s slider, which he has advanced feel for locating down and away to righties, ranges from 83-87 mph with big depth and late tilt. His curveball is a deep, vertical breaker that doesn’t maintain the consistent tightness his slider does. Cecconi’s changeup has taken a noticeable step forward both in terms of its usage and quality. So far in 2024, he has thrown the pitch 14% of the time between his time in Triple-A and Phoenix, compared to only 5% in 2023. He’s very effective at mimicking his fastball arm speed when throwing the changeup to give it additional deception, and its late fade and depth gives him another tool, especially against lefties.

The slick-fielding, zone-controlling Yinzer high school draftee has plus defensive hands and actions, and is a virtual lock to stay at shortstop. He's compactly built and not especially strong, but Rincon tracks pitches well, rarely chases, and moves the bat around the zone from both sides of the plate. His swing isn't always well connected from the ground up, especially his right-handed swing, which often features an awkward weight transfer; in Rincon's lefty swing, his hands have a late move that sometimes causes his whole operation to be tardy. The latter issue is small enough to project that it will get cleaned up with time. Otherwise, Rincon's cut is short and to the point but still has a fair amount of natural lift. 
A high-probability utility prospect in the Geraldo Perdomo mold, Rincon has terrific soft skills, and his ceiling will be dictated by how much stronger he can get. Because we're not talking about a super projectable frame in this case, I'm not inclined to forecast a huge uptick in that realm, but the progression of Rincon's measurable power from 2022 to 2023 (16% hard-hit rate to 25%, with a max exit velo that rose nearly 10 ticks to 108 mph) was pretty substantial.",,"sa3020221"

As he's bulked up and gotten stronger since college, he's lost a fair bit of his mobility and athleticism and has slid down the defensive spectrum to play first base in addition to his usual second and third, where he has not been good. By far Foscue's most exceptional skill is his bat-to-ball ability. He had a 91% in-zone contact rate in 2023, which would have ranked just behind Jake Cronenworth among big league first basemen and would have been in the top 15 of qualified hitters regardless of position. He crowds the plate and works the middle of the field and his pull side, and that's it. His short levers help him stay on time and connect with just about everything in the strike zone, and after he went through a phase of passivity at the plate, Foscue has dialed in a very measured approach that had him walking more than he struck out at Triple-A last year. His paltry 3% barrel rate would easily be last among big league first baseman, however. Even though Foscue has gotten beefier, his power output is still south of the big league average, let alone what is typical at a corner infield position. He's flawed and needs a lefty-hitting, good-gloved complement to help hide his issues, but Foscue should still be a pretty solid part-time player.

His pre-draft resume was largely built on one huge year of performance as a junior, and he signed for just $750,000 in the second round. Manzardo has raked all the way up the minor league ladder, slashing .284/.384/.542 in the minors overall and .239/.340/.470 in 2023 at Triple-A across the Rays and Guardians orgs. Cleveland acquired Manzardo for Aaron Civale at the 2023 trade deadline, and he looked like he was winning the battle to be the club's primary first baseman during big league spring training this year, but he was reassigned to minor league camp in mid-March. 
Manzardo's feel to hit has carried most of his profile's weight his entire time as a prospect. In 2022, it looked like he might have special, John Olerud-level feel for contact, but across the last year and a half, his performance in this regard has been more ""very good"" than ""exceptional."" His 2023 contact rates (79% overall, 87% in the zone) are both better than average (even among first basemen) but not quite to the level of a Yandy Díaz, Wilmer Flores, or the other very successful first basemen who share Manzardo's lack of huge raw power. One takeaway from my recent audit of the 2017 Top 100 was that the first basemen without huge power tended to produce below my expectations across their pre-free agency seasons, and that was a big part of why Manzardo slid some compared to last season's evaluation. He's still a good hitter who is going to help stabilize a position that has been subject to odd, late-season experimentation each of the last couple of years (Gabriel Arias and Kole Calhoun), but Manzardo is probably a ""win with"" first baseman rather than a 30-homer, ""win because of"" guy. He looks stronger to me this spring than he did in the 2023 Fall League and I think he clearly worked hard in the weight room during the offseason, but I checked with a front office person who hasn't seen a meaningful uptick in his measureable power this spring, and I still think Manzardo is more likely to slug closer to .400 than .450 during the next half decade.","NYcorz8qbeI","29794"

Obviously, in Yandy's case, this has been fine, and he's turned into a very productive big leaguer even though he slid from shortstop to third base as a prospect. Alvarez's early-career performance indicates his feel for the zone and contact are both special enough that he might traverse a similar medium-impact path. 
While stout and relatively projectionless, Alvarez is loose and rotates well in the batter's box, and he moves well on the bases. He often lets the baseball travel deep in the zone and has the barrel feel to pepper the opposite gap, though not with meaningful extra-base power. Alvarez looks less and less likely to stick at shortstop (he doesn't have the range, athleticism, or arm strength), but the Braves have not deployed him at other positions with any sort of frequency since 2022. Based on the way Alvarez tends to be positioned on defense — he starts closer to third base than the typical shortstop and as a result gets to make most plays coming in and moving from right to left — he's going to have plenty of experience making the kinds of plays that are typical at third base. He seems likeliest to transition there, where he could be quite good. While I'm trying to be mindful of the impact his elite plate discipline will have on his output, it's tough to project an impact future for a third baseman who seems pretty likely to slug below .400 across his years of team control.

The results have mostly been encouraging, as the shallower angle this creates on his fastball has fostered more in-zone bat-missing ability and better natural action on a changeup that needed to develop for Madden to hit his ceiling. 
I think that some of his uncharacteristic wildness in 2023 was simply from this delivery being relatively new. Madden's walk rate was high, but he has pitchability elements. He can manipulate breaking ball shape and either throw his slider for a strike or bury it for whiffs, he has a low-90s cutter that he's still getting a feel for, and he knows where in the zone his fastball plays. Even in his final start of the year, Madden was parked in the 94-95 mph range. I consider him a high-probability no. 4/5 starter whose ETA is more likely 2025 due to the sudden glut of healthy and veteran options who are now ahead of Madden on the depth chart.",,"30140"

His exit velos were as high as anyone's in the class, including Dylan Crews, it's just that Matthews' feel to hit was not good. He didn't swing and miss excessively in college, but the visual evaluation of his hit tool wasn't great, and Matthews especially struggled to get on top of high fastballs. He is a plus runner and will show you a max-effort plus arm, but Matthews is also a crude defender at short and isn't a lock to stay there. He's often slow to approach choppers in front of him and has to rush once he has the baseball, and his throwing accuracy is a mixed bag. The last time the Astros took a player whose scouting report read like this — huge tools college guy with hit tool risk — it was George Springer. 
Matthews got 156 plate appearances after the draft last summer, primarily with Low-A Fayetteville, where he had a 26.7% strikeout rate and only produced 10 extra-base hits. He spent nearly a month on the IL with a lower back issue early in 2024 and has been white hot since returning. Matthews hits out of a square, balanced setup with a simple stride and his bat path tends to be on the flatter side, with solid bat speed through the zone. We want to let him air out in pro ball for a while before revisiting his FV grade. He was always going to be a bit of a slow burn, a toolsy dev project typical of Houston's high-variance style of drafting when it comes to hitters.",,"sa3022563"

After watching him for a couple of weeks, it was clear he belonged with a more advanced tier of player. He mashed during his brief time in Arizona and was sent back to the D.R. prior to extended spring training to get ready for the DSL season. After a couple of dominant weeks in the DSL, he broke his left wrist while diving for a ball in the outfield and his season was over. Arias again looked fantastic during 2024 minor league spring training and during the early portion of extended, but in the week prior to list publication, he again dove for a ball in the outfield, got up in pain, and slammed his glove to the turf in frustration. A Giants source relayed that it's just a sprain this time, but it's something to keep an eye on. 
Arias is a big-framed, physical corner outfield prospect with heart-of-the-order power potential. He's built like an NBA combo guard and only turns 18 a few days before the start of the 2024 complex slate. He is already quite strong and should have superlative physicality at maturity. Though his swing looks a little longer and has more scoop and lift during 2024 looks, he has also shown an ability to be short to the baseball with power. His swing path is somewhat grooved and there hasn't been a ton of barrel variability during in-person looks, but because of his injuries, we still don't have a great sense of Arias' bat-to-ball ability from a data standpoint because the sample is too small (though his 76 PA sample from 2023 was strong). 
Arias is most often playing center field right now, but he isn't able to get to the balls in play that look like 50/50 propositions off the bat and his size means it's very likely he matures into a corner. As such, the hit tool piece of things (and how much power Arias can get to as a result) is of paramount importance to his profile. Arias was an offseason Pick to Click and is still tracking as hoped, though we likely won't move him into the Top 100 until we have contact data that reinforces our eyeball look.","MARcQ6Oohoc","sa3021076"

In a 2023 season that spanned High- and Double-A, Vaz struck out in less than 10% of his trips to the plate on his way to .279/.373/.400 line and 30 stolen bases in 33 attempts. He's slashed .253/.369/.370 at Northwest Arkansas so far this year, good for a 114 wRC+. 
Vaz very rarely swings and misses, which is reflected in his sub-10% in-zone whiff and 3.8% swinging strike rate against Double-A arms this season. Vaz makes good swing decisions, continues to walk more frequently than he strikes out, and is advanced in his ability to manipulate the bat in the zone. His short levers produce a compact, direct path that fits his spray-it-around approach, but he lacks extra base impact. 
Vaz is still spending the bulk of his time at second base, where his hands work well and he shows solid instincts and overall feel for the position. His quick-twitch characteristics are more apparent when he gets the occasional game at shortstop, but his arm is a little light to complete the longer throws from the hole. Vaz is also a solid defender in left field, where he looks comfortable tracking and ranging for balls in all directions.

Guzman's tools are like Diet Willy Adames. He has cleaned up some of the odd looking aspects of his defensive actions (which were really only strange and stiff when he had to make plays in on the grass) and continues to be great at backhanding balls in the hole and making strong throws back across his body. Guzman is also an impressive in-the-box rotator and swings pretty hard for a 20-year-old, but his cut is quite long. He's had concerningly high strikeout rates in the low minors, and it's tough to forecast him as an everyday player because of this. This is where one could argue Guzman's skill set is structured like Adames', but Guzman isn't tooled up to that degree (Willy is a 7 defender with 6 power).

Last year was Snelling's first season of professional baseball and he rose quickly through the Padres system, starting the season at Low-A and finishing it at Double-A as a 19-year-old. 
The evaluation of Snelling here at FanGraphs has been lukewarm since he was an amateur. His delivery requires a ton of effort and features quite a bit of head violence, and in our (mostly Eric's) opinion his stuff is only fair. Snelling's best pitch is his uphill low-90s fastball, which has lost a couple of ticks this year. The pitch lives more off of angle and deception than riding life and velocity. None of Snelling's secondary pitches have generated an above-average rate of swing-and-miss as a pro, and that includes his 2023 season with the sterling ERAs. 
His 84-87 mph changeup has been his most used secondary offering so far in 2024, which might be a developmental effort rather than an indication that it's his out-pitch. It isn't great from a stuff standpoint. Snelling's arm speed when he throws it is actually pretty good, but it lacks movement. The better of his secondary offerings is his 78-80 mph, 2,200 rpm slider, which is effective as a strike-stealing pitch but lacks the depth of a finisher. Snelling goes right at hitters and is a poised on-mound competitor. He's going to throw enough strikes to be a starter, but his stuff quality is going to limit his impact.

Ashcraft's bread-and-butter pitch is his 88 mph slider, which has impressive length and depth for such a hard pitch. As of list publication, it's generating incredible chase and miss rates north of 40%, as is Ashcraft's slower, 82-85 mph curveball, which he uses more as a backfoot weapon against lefties. Though his arm angle creates relatively ineffective movement on his fastball, Ashcraft's mid-90s velocity makes up for it somewhat. Similar to Quinn Priester, there might be some issues with Ashcraft's fastball getting hit, or at least he may have to pitch off his breaking stuff more frequently against big league hitters and thus operate less efficiently from a strike-throwing standpoint. He has never had issues throwing strikes in pro ball but also hasn't demonstrated starter-level durability because his career has been interrupted by injury and the pandemic. He's already set a single-season career high for innings in 2024, his seventh in pro ball. If Ashcraft can maintain this level of velocity and control across 100-plus innings the rest of the 2024 season, then he'll have an argument to make the back of the Top 100 list in the offseason, though his fastball's playability might continue to be a barrier.",,"sa3008470"

While he hit a robust .300/.417/.520 (with a .390 BABIP) at Norfolk last year and overall had a .280/.399/.498 line at Triple-A in 114 career games, there were visual, as well as underlying statistical issues, that had Eric projecting Cowser as a good player rather than a great one even before Cowser hit .115/.286/.148 and played his way off the Orioles' playoff roster in 2023. So far this forecast has been light. Cowser showed up to 2024 spring training having added a grade of power to his game. He had an incredible 2024 Grapefruit League, broke camp with the big league squad, and is hitting for enough power to be an everyday-quality offensive player even as his strikeouts have climbed like they were forecast to here at FG. 
Let's recount what Eric perceived to be Cowser's strengths and weaknesses entering the season, and examine how those have played out so far. The gap between Cowser's overall chase rate in 2023 (way better than league average, minors included) and his two-strike chase rate (substantially worse than average) is indicative of a very selective approach, and perhaps also of predetermined takes early in the count. This was interpreted as an indication that Cowser's elite minor league walk rates would come down once he was in the big leagues. So far that has been correct. Cowser's 2024 chase splits are still pretty dramatic (27% overall, 44% with two strikes), and his walk rate has come down from the 16-17% he showed throughout the minors to 9.6% so far in 2024. 
Eric also wasn't forecasting an average or better hit tool here. Cowser ran a 70% contact rate and 80% in-zone contact rate in 2023 (combined at Norfolk and Baltimore), both of which are below the big league outfield average. Eyeball scouting corroborated this. Cowser's head was flying all over the place throughout his swing and Eric singled out a tendency to swing over the top of soft stuff that finishes in the lower half of strike zone. This has also held true so far in 2024, as Cowser is striking out nearly 30% of the time (38% vs LHP) and struggling badly with offspeed pitches. 
Cowser's wrists are very strong and he's capable of doing damage even when the rest of his swing is not well-timed or connected, including to the opposite field. He had a 47% hard-hit rate combined between Norfolk and the big leagues last season (the major league average for outfielders in 2023 was 39.4%), but his peak exits were closer to the big league average. There was impressive pound-for-pound quality contact here, but not big raw juice. That has changed. Cowser is hitting the ball harder in 2024, with his hard-hit rate is up over 50% and his max exit velos comfortably plus. At age 24 there was an assumption that Cowser was done developing in this way, but he's instead taken a leap. Cowser is being deployed in such a way that three quarters of his at-bats come against right-handed pitching and he's been a plus left field defender. If you like, you can mentally map him right next to Astros outfielder Jacob Melton on the Top 100 list since those two have similar skill sets now that Cowser's power has ticked up. There's been no change to the FV grade here because Cowser graduated pretty early in 2024 and Eric just has to live with being wrong if indeed Cowser keeps performing like this.",,"29591"

Peete has uncommon size for a potential shortstop at a leggy 6-foot-2. His range and ability to bend is pretty amazing at his size, and Peete is surprisingly smooth making plays in on the grass. It's his hands that need to get much better if Peete is going to stick on the infield. Lot of defenders have success improving their hands through side work and practice, so  at this stage I'm more inclined to be excited by Peete's potential to join the ranks of massive-framed power-hitting shortstops than I am worried about how crude his hands currently are. 
Of the Mariners' high school position player group from last year's draft, Peete seemed the most overwhelmed by his initial exposure to pro pitching. His front side still bails way out toward first base on too many of his swings, leaving him vulnerable on the outer half of the plate. But Peete's size gives him rare power projection, and he rotates beautifully and has shown he can muster pull power despite the length of his levers. His swing's natural loft is going to help him get to power in games, and Peete is going to grow into a lot of it. Peete's contact data (12% swinging strike rate, a 6-to-5 ball in play-to-swinging strike ratio) aren't red flags; the perceived hit tool risk here is coming from a visual evaluation of Peete's swing and an expectation of it being more of an issue as he climbs.

Campbell has been shot out of the pro ball cannon. He has an OPS over 1.000 as of list publication, and he's been performing at Double-A Portland for the better part of the last month. At Georgia Tech, Campbell was an outstanding slash-and-dash leadoff man who was among the most difficult Division-I hitters to make swing and miss during the 2023 season. He hit .376/.484/.549 and struck out just 17 times in 217 PA during his draft year as an age-eligible redshirt freshman. 
Subtle changes to the way his hands load, as well as alterations to his approach, have resulted in a seismic shift in his profile. Campbell is swinging with damage-seeking intent and has been able to lift the ball more. The power he's generating with his new style is shocking. His high-end exit velocities are comfortably plus on the big league scale (he hit a ball 114 mph this year) and he's doing huge damage to all fields. While these changes have come at the expense of Campbell's ability to make contact (he had a 90% contact rate in college and has yo-yo'd around the 70-77% range so far as a pro), keep in mind that this might improve as he gets comfortable with his new swing. His cut still looks weird, like it did in college, when he was often chopping down at the baseball. Unlike a lot of the powerless college bat-control mavens who go on Day Two of the draft, Campbell isn't undersized or relatively unathletic; he's a strapping 6-foot-3 guy with explosive rotational athleticism. This isn't a skills-over-tools type who doesn't check the physical scouting boxes; this is a projectable athlete who hasn't played a ton of high level baseball yet (recall that he was an age-eligible redshirt freshman with one year of college experience), and still he's having huge success at Double-A. 
Campbell played second base at Tech but has also played a lot of center field so far this year. He's a plus runner who has the wheels for it, but he needs reps to improve his feel. His athleticism has bailed him out of some bad reads; Campbell will get twisted around out there and still find a crazy way to make the play, which is pretty exciting given the context of his development. 
I don't think Campbell is going to have a Bondsian OPS forever, but I do buy that there have been meaningful changes here that have unlocked dormant impact power. The ""contact-only second baseman makes swing changes and moves to center field"" plot summary reads almost exactly like Jarren Duran's scouting report did when he first broke out in the lower minors. Campbell's swing is still so odd and requires such effort that I'd like to see him sustain a high level of performance against upper-level pitching for a little while longer before he moves into the Top 100, but he's certainly on that trajectory.",,"sa3023011"

Bernal’s defensive chops make him an easy evaluation as a long-term catcher and he's a well-rounded player overall, albeit one who lacks a plus tool.

His actions are still a little too slow for the big leagues, but Kinney makes plays around the bag with poise and comfort and has enough range for the position. 
Because Kinney has slimmed, he and his broad-shouldered frame now have upward long-term power projection, which is exciting because Kinney is already posting a hard-hit rate around 45% at High-A Bowling Green. For a college-aged prospect to have an OPS over .800 in the mid-minors is very encouraging, and even though Kinney's swing leaves him vulnerable to high-and-away fastballs, he otherwise has good plate coverage and feel for all-fields spray. He's going to be a doubles machine, and it's plausible that he'll add enough strength to turn a bunch of those doubles into homers. He's on pace to nearly double his, uh, doubles total from last year, in part because Kinney's feel for lifting the ball has been improving throughout 2024.

Across the rest of the season, including a cup of coffee at the big league level, Phillips regressed to the walk-prone ways (43 free passes in his final 61 innings) that have clouded his profile with relief risk since he entered pro ball. 
Phillips hasn't demonstrated the control to start, but he has demonstrated the durability, and his fastball averaged just north of 96 mph across 120 innings in 2023 and is back in that area to start 2024. Despite its movement, Phillips' stuff doesn't garner a high rate of chase because he throws too many non-competitive pitches nowhere near the zone, and his fastball has a shockingly low swinging strike rate for such a hard pitch with this much vertical break. Phillips is also built like a big catcher. He's the sort of powerful, tightly wound athlete more commonly found in the bullpen. With all three of Phillips' option years left, the Reds might let him start for a while longer to see if his command has late improvement before they convert him.

Even though aspects of his fastball plane and shape were clearly not optimal, Echavarria's breaking ball quality made him one of the more exciting high school pitchers in the 2023 draft, and he signed for $3 million rather than go to Florida. He pitched during 2023 instructs (that's where the linked video is from) and in 2024 extended spring training before making his affiliate debut at Stockton a few days before list publication. 
Echavarria's breaking ball is nasty. His arm slot makes it so that pitch is only ever descending; it doesn't float up out of his hand in an identifiable way. Last year, it was a plus curveball in the upper-70s; this spring, it's had more of a slider look in the 84-86 mph range. The latter was deployed in a shorter outing as Echavarria got going in Arizona, and he may well have two breaking balls now. I thought he flashed plus mid-80s changeups on the showcase circuit in 2022, but he's barely thrown the pitch during my scout sources' looks this spring. His fastball strikes are inconsistent, and sometimes he spins on the heel of his front foot as it catches his motion and he loses his line to the plate. It's pretty typical for pitchers with levers this long to scatter their fastballs at this age, and Echavarria's control is fine enough and his delivery smooth enough to project him as a starter. His frame is projectable on paper, but I'm inclined to round down on his fastball growth a little bit. This isn't a broadly built 6-foot-4 guy; he's 6-foot-1 with narrow, rounded shoulders. If he can simply maintain the mid-90s heat he's shown so far (he was 92-96 in his first Low-A outing) under a pro load of innings, it will be a win.

He's been deployed as a starter so far in pro ball, but with a frame and delivery like his, he's almost certainly destined for the bullpen. 
Diaz has a lean, medium frame with fair physical projection. He throws from a high three-quarters slot with a medium arm circle that does have a stab in the arm path and an elevated front arm throughout his delivery. Every pitch he throws features maximum effort, and he falls off to the first base side quite dramatically. Yilber's carrying fastball sits in the mid-90s and touches the upper-90s. It consistently misses bats but is held back a bit due to his inconsistent control of the pitch. His slider ranges between 84-87 mph; it has both vertical and horizontal break, and regularly shows plus tightness (2,800 rpm). Rounding out Diaz’s mix is a curveball (78-81 mph) that varies between 12/6 and 11/5 shape, with both versions having significant depth along with plus spin (2,800 rpm). The harder breaking ball is newer, and ticks one of the developmental checkpoints mentioned in last year's report (the need for a third pitch) on Diaz's developmental road as a starter. It has improved his chances of being a starter long-term, but he's still more likely to be a late-inning weapon, maybe even at some point this year. It's plausible that the D-backs will consider him one of their 12 nastiest arms late in the season and, at least temporarily, shift him to the bullpen for the stretch run. Even if they don't, Diaz is a virtual lock to be added to their 40-man after the season and be in the rotation/swingman mix the way Drey Jameson and Ryne Nelson were early last year.",,"29271"

He also has lots to work on defensively, right on down to the way he crouches, but that's typical of a catcher this age. Tait's plus lefty bat speed and overt big league physicality give him the ceiling of a power-hitting primary catcher. There is hit tool risk stemming from his immature feel for the zone and tendency to swing underneath fastballs in the up-and-away part of the zone, but Tait has viable big league strength right now, at age 17, which I can't say for any other teenage hitter in the org.",,"sa3022162"

Santos' stuff isn't meaningfully different than last year. His fastball is still his best pitch, topping out at 98 with plus riding life. His secondary pitches are more frequently average than plus in terms of their pure nastiness, but Santos' command has begun to emerge as a potentially special aspect of his game and is elevating how they play. He's always thrown plenty of strikes (this is a very athletic 6-foot tall righty with a simple operation), but his release has grown more and more consistent, and Santos' stuff is more often in an enticing but unhittable location. His delivery is so effortless and easy that Santos looks like he'll sustain his velo across a starter's load of innings. He's already done so under a 100-inning load and is on pace for a little more than that this season. Santos looks more likely to be parked at the back of a good rotation now and he's a virtual lock to be added to the Rangers' 40-man roster after the season, making it likely that he plays a spot starter role next year.

His defense needs a ton of work, but he's a fairly athletic mover with the size to withstand 100 games worth of the beating catchers take. Ralphy's arm isn't great and his tendency is to be very active back there when, a lot of the time, good catchers operate with stillness and control. But Velazquez is a pretty good all-around athlete and amid his general inconsistency are flashes of rare defensive ability. The most catching my scout sources and I have seen him do since turning pro, however, has come when he has warmed up the pitcher, so he hasn't even had an opportunity to quell concerns about his defense yet. 
He might hit enough to profile at a corner position even if it turns out he can't stay behind the plate. It looks like he's already made a swing tweak that has shortened up his operation without sacrificing power. Often when a catching prospect's bat is very far ahead of his defense, he ends up moving off the position because of timing rather than ineptitude (e.g. at some point, both the bat and theoretical 1B/OF defense will be ready sooner than one can be expected to develop as a catcher). That's feasible for Velazquez and some would even call it likely, but a decision like that is several years away. For now, he's a very volatile, high-variance developmental catching prospect with substantial ceiling.","Vqj6oXNwLF0","sa3023013"

He has easy pull-side power, with deft, precise control of the barrel working to generate big all-around offense, enough that Perdomo could profile as an everyday player even if he ends up being too big for shortstop pretty quickly. Perdomo does some slick things at short, he's just rather stocky and slightly stiff compared to a typical top-of-the-class prospect. His vertical barrel variability is incredible for a player his age, though his front side is a little stiff through contact and he might be tested by pro breaking stuff in the bottom third of the zone, the same way Spencer Torkelson has been. 
Perdomo has a great offensive foundation for an amateur prospect, which might allow him to move quickly through the lower minors. The Braves seem to think so too, assigning Perdomo directly to the Florida Complex League in 2024 rather than the DSL like basically every other new signee. He is on the 60-day IL with a hamstring injury and hasn't played as of list publication, but a source indicated to FanGraphs that the Braves still expect he'll play this year.

He's been very good as a pro, slashing .269/.373/.446 with San Diego leading up to the Luis Arraez trade. 
Martorella's uppercut swing in among the more entertaining ones in baseball. He's much more athletic in the batter's box than in the field, at times finishing his swing on one knee. Despite his swing's effort and ferocity, Martorella's measured peak power is closer to big league average than it is to plus. Still, the quality of his approach and the big lift in his swing will help ensure he gets to all the power. Martorella's tools aren't big enough to project him as a big time first baseman, but you can win with this guy as a 1B/DH who you spell versus lefties.

Brock was healthy and deployed in long relief during his first full pro season in 2023, and the Jays promoted him fairly aggressively to Double-A New Hampshire, where he spent most of the year. All told, Brock stuck out 87 hitters in 52.2 innings. It appears the Jays tweaked his delivery a bit — his slot looks a tad higher now than it did in college, shifting the axis of Brock's fastball for the better. His best pitch is easily his slider, which Brock has thrown more than his fastball since college. It has a late, nasty, downward movement and uncommon velocity, bending in at 87-90 mph. Hitters don't seem to be able to pick it up, and it's a weapon against righties and lefties alike.

He sat 93-96 throughout 2023 and is back there again to start 2024, and while he lacks precise feel for fastball command, his delivery is direct to the plate and Chivilli's style of fastball utility doesn't require him to dot his heater east and west. I actually wonder if Chivilli can start. He's kept his walks under control during his time in the minors, he's loose and athletic, and in addition to the power mid-80s changeup, he has a fair mid-80s slider that he can land for a strike. He threw 61 innings last year in what was largely a single-inning relief role, which he appears to be in again at Hartford early in 2024. I think the Rockies should consider stretching Chivilli out in long relief to set him up for a potential transition to the rotation if things go well. The problem is that he's already on the 40-man and it would probably take the better part of his first two option years to actually find out if that's a good fit.

As an amateur, Sykora touched triple-digits with his fastball and tended to sit between 94-98 mph. So far in 2024, his fastball has averaged 95 mph and topped out at 98. Sykora’s height and high three-quarters arm slot create a downhill angle that causes his fastball to play down when it finishes in the meat of the zone, but his fastball command is fairly advanced for a pitcher his size and age, and he tends to live around the top of the zone where his heater plays best. His above-average extension helps the fastball, too. His splitter is a low-to-mid-80s offering that can vary greatly in quality from pitch to pitch at present. Developing consistency here is going to be key for Sykora to hit his mid-rotation ceiling. At its best, the splitter will show late bottom action, while at other times, it has minimal movement altogether. His slider (80-84 mph) has a lot of depth along with late tilt when he stays on top of it, and it's generating a miss rate north of 50% as of list publication. Sykora's arm stroke is perhaps a little bit late, but he's never had issues repeating it.

And Meadows is going to stay in center. Even at his size, he's a comfortably plus runner who looked crisp patrolling Comerica Park's sizable path of real estate in September. 
Meadows is a little too long and vulnerable against up-and-away fastballs to project sustained offensive performance at this level, and he swings inside a lot of righty changeups as he cheats to try to cover that pitch. Execute a belt-high fastball and soft pitch away from him in sequence, and you're either getting him out or limiting his raw power. He lacks the plus offensive attribute of an impact everyday player, but Meadows can oppo-poke soft pitches that don't quite finish, and he crushes heart-of-the-plate mistakes.

Matthews has barely walked anyone the last half decade. Since his freshman year at Western Carolina, he has walked 48 of the 1,440 batters he's faced (as of list publication), which is a (takes out magnifying glass) 3% rate. This is a fairly extreme control-over-command profile. Put on Matthews' tape and he's living in the zone with incredible consistency but isn't dotting his pitches exactly where he wants. Because of the way his fastball plays in the zone, though, that's fine for him. He generates a ton of whiffs up and to his arm side despite a downhill approach angle because of ride and deception. Matthews' slider and cutter pair nicely with one another, and some of them have dastardly late bite. His sliders have enough due south movement to play as bat-missers against lefties. That's an important component because Matthews lacks a good changeup; in fact, his changeup usage has dipped substantially this year. There's enough here to project Matthews as an efficient no. 4/5 starter, and probably soon.

He has taken a power-over-precision approach with his fastball so far in pro ball, leaning on it at about a 70% clip so far in San Jose, and Whitman's size and the pacing of his delivery causes his heater to jump on hitters. His slider has plus teeth and two-planed depth at its best, and we're projecting heavily on Whitman's changeup here because of the quality of his arm action and athleticism.

Even when Acuña has hit well in the past, he has had issues with chase and plate coverage. Instead, it was his remarkable bat speed, which generates surprising power for a hitter his size, that made Acuña a potential impact shortstop who lived toward the back of the Top 100 list. The way his body rotates about his hips as he swings is beautiful, and he has a certain verve and power potential that few 5-foot-8 hitters possess, but Acuña has only performed for fits and starts of the last couple of seasons.
Acuña's hands on defense can be clumsy.

It seems like it takes Valenzuela a little while to adjust to each new level. He has had a dip in production upon each of his last two promotions before rebounding in his second attempt. Much more comfortable from the left side than the right, Valenzuela's hands have an aggressive load from both sides of the plate and produce lots of airborne contact. Catchers with this kind of physicality are rare, let alone ones who switch-hit. It's tough to call Valenzuela a primary catching prospect because he lacks a plus tool and really needs to sandbag the baseball better. But he also looks like more than just a backup.

A monstrous 6-foot-5, 220-pound shortstop and first baseman at Ohio State, Dezenzo had a breakout 2023 at the plate when he slashed .305/.383/.531 across High- and Double-A and saw time at several new defensive positions. A wrist issue kept him out for the first two months of 2024; Dezenzo began rehabbing on the complex shortly before list publication. 
Dezenzo's physicality and power are exceptional, but even with his strong surface performance, you can ask reasonable questions about both his ability to hit for contact and where he'll be able to play defense. Dezenzo was regularly beaten by fastballs at the belt in 2023 and he wasn't facing anything close to big league velocity. This, as well as a greater-than-average vulnerability to in-zone sliders, leads us to believe Dezenzo is due for a regression in the contact department. On defense, Dezenzo has plus footwork and arm strength but below-average hands. He's quite flexible for his size and plays defense low to the ground, but even when he's in great position to field the baseball, he's flub-prone. We're bullish that Dezenzo will improve enough in this area to be a viable third baseman, and his other attributes there are actually pretty rare and exciting. Like late-career Eugenio Suárez, Dezenzo could club about 25 homers while striking out 30% of the time during his prime years.

Ortiz still needs to get stronger at the dish. He is swinging underneath tons of in-zone fastballs because he has to wind up his entire little body to swing hard, causing him to be late.

He looked nasty in a college summer league prior to the draft and buoyed his prospects. The Dodgers further harnessed his stuff — at best he was 94-97 with two plus breaking balls, and Nastrini put up impressive strikeout numbers at High- and Double-A in 2022. He was evaluated just outside the Top 100 prospects list that year, kept off by his poor control. When Nastrini returned to Double-A in 2023, at this time still with the Dodgers, his strikeout fell by nearly 10 percentage points, and he did nothing to allay concerns about his command. Positioned as a Pick to Click, his performance plateaued. Even while his numbers sagged, his swinging strike rate was still among the best in the minor leagues, and sure enough his overall numbers improved again after he was traded to the White Sox as part of the deal that sent Lance Lynn and Joe Kelly to the Dodgers. 
Nastrini's fastball alone will enable him to miss bats thanks to consistent mid-90s velocity and a healthy dose of vertical break. His robust arsenal of secondaries play well off one another. He’ll call upon his heater to miss bats, confounding hitters on both sides of the plate with its rise and cut. Then he’ll further frustrate his opponents with two distinct breaking balls – a slider and a curveball with drastically different shapes and velocities – or his changeup, which mirrors his slider in a way that makes it very effective against lefties. His entire arsenal is more vertical than horizontal, with all three secondaries featuring varying degrees of drop that allow them to complement one another. 
But his command is still the sticking point, as the offerings he tosses out of the zone are usually big misses rather than strategically placed attempts to get chase swings. If he can hone that command, he could comfortably slot in towards the middle of a starting rotation, but if he can't, he'll still be impactful as a single-inning, late-game reliever. The White Sox have the luxury of letting Nastrini try to start for as long as possible during the early stages of their rebuild. Things might be bumpy early on, but over time a guy whose stuff is this good will find a way to be an impact pitcher of some stripe.","66ndZ5SD8O4","29833"

Previously compared to Juan Pierre because of his build, swing, and speed, Bradfield's idea of the strike zone is much better than Pierre's, and he walked more than he struck out throughout his college career, no small feat against SEC pitching. He tends to do slash-and-dash singles damage to all fields, which has remained true in pro ball even though the Orioles have overhauled his swing. Most true everyday center fielders produce close to average power, and Bradfield probably needs to out-hit his pre-draft contact projection to be a true 2-WAR everyday option. It looks like he might. He has an 84% contact rate and minute 5.7% swinging strike rate as of publication, and he's doing that amid tweaks to both his bat's angle of attack and his lower half usage. There are still all kinds of other statistical indicators that say Bradfield is going to have trouble actualizing any kind of power, but he might make enough contact to be a Michael Bourn or Gregor Blanco type player. We'd like to see him do this against Double-A pitching for a while before stuffing him in the Top 100.",,"sa3022917"

It wasn't until he transferred to Winthrop that he began to pitch regularly in a starter role, and he still managed to lead the Eagles in homers during his draft year even though Hopkins was becoming an ""arrow up"" prospect on the mound. Hopkins' big frame and delivery evoke Tanner Houck, or a little less limber Camilo Doval. The backfield version of Doval is perhaps the most apt comparison because Hopkins is also attempting to harness considerable low-slot arm speed and has crude feel for release. 
Hop is a broad-shouldered 6-foot-4 and has a low-slot, drop-and-drive style, with his arm stroke happening suddenly at the very end of his delivery. This wreaks havoc on hitters' timing and creates exploding rise and tail life up around the hands of righties. He has been up to 99 and, in his first year of focusing on pitching, is throwing a decent number of strikes. Obviously, with an arm slot like Hopkins', his slider spells trouble for righties. This pitch has variable movement in the 86-92 mph range. Some of them look like cutters, while others have more length and depth. It used to be that pitchers with deliveries like this were rarely found in a rotation, but that's not really true anymore and it's becoming less true all the time. If Hopkins can develop a changeup and/or a well-commanded cutter, anything to flesh out his repertoire, he has a great chance to be a mid-rotation starter. There are all kinds of late bloomer traits here. Pitching full-time is still very new to him and Hopkins checks basically every athletic box on the scout card. This is a very exciting pitching prospect whose floor feels like that of a nasty late-inning reliever. He has a mid-rotation ceiling if he sustains this velo and finds a third pitch, and has quickly become the most exciting pitching prospect in this system.",,"sa3023515"

Guerrero has a powerful, picturesque swing that produces all-fields pop. It's a tad long, but Guerrero easily has the strength to hit for power the other way even when he's late into the hitting zone. This is a very physical 18-year-old — if he showed up for your high school's football tryouts he'd be sent to work out with the defensive ends. He's playing center field right now but probably isn't a long-term fit there, as he's running in the 4.3s already and will probably keep filling out as he matures. The early-career strikeout rates here create enough risk to hold Guerrero in the FV tier typically associated with corner platoon bats (he's also playing a fair bit of right field). That feels like the middle of his potential outcomes, a power-over-hit corner profile that plays against righties in a big way. That doesn't mean Guerrero lacks everyday upside; it's plausible last year's missed reps are the root cause of his current strikeout issues and that he'll remedy them with time.",,"sa3021072"

He maintained that performance amid a 40-inning uptick in workload and a second half promotion to Double-A. He averaged 93-96 mph on his fastballs as part of an evenly deployed three- or four-pitch mix. Aguiar commands his heater to his glove side with remarkable consistency, but its sinking action makes it less apt to miss bats than is typical of a fastball that hard. His command enables him to set up his fantastic low-80s slider, which he also commands with robotic consistency. Aguiar can vary the shape of his breaking ball depending on whether he wants to land it for a strike or generate chase, so even though all of them are the same velocity, he effectively has a slider and curveball. Aguiar will also use his low-80s changeup against hitters of either handedness; it typically finishes with sink at or below the strike zone, where it can't be crushed. It gives him an arm-side weapon to fill out his east/west style of operation. Plus command really makes Aguiar's entire repertoire sing and it's why he's projected as a contender's no. 4/5. He's a likely post-2024 40-man add who'll probably play an up/down role in 2025 before establishing himself as a factor in the Reds rotation soon after.","Yb6IVmY4NIw","30031"

Skilled and entertaining as hell, Barrosa is a plus runner and outfield defender with plus bat-to-ball ability from both sides of the plate. He slugged .456 at Triple-A last year and has 13 homers in each of the last two seasons, but that is likely a caricature of his power created by the hitting environment at Arizona's upper-level affiliates. 
This is a slash-and-dash style hitter who sprays light contact all over the place. He makes in-flight adjustments to breaking balls, is naturally short to elevated fastballs, and can get deep into his legs to dip and impact pitches in the lower third. While Barrosa's somewhat elaborate footwork can sometimes disrupt his timing, it's essential to him winding up his body and swinging hard, and his stroke is otherwise short, direct, and flat, which is conducive to making contact all over the zone. From the left side, the momentum of Barrosa's swing naturally carries him towards first base, and he can get down the line in under 4.10 seconds.

He runs 4.10 from home to first and has incredible range on defense. He can make acrobatic throws (the jump throw is a favorite of Cauley's) and often has to because he doesn't have the plant-and-throw hose of a typical shortstop (he's also had some throwing accuracy issues in the past, which now seem remedied). Cauley is an athletic fit at every position, but he's only played the infield so far in pro ball. His little frame skips across the dirt like a stone on a lake and he gets to grounders you assume are hits as they leave the bat. He has a chance to be a Gold Glove defender at shortstop and has the speed to play center field if the Rangers are inclined to try him out there. 
Because Cauley has consistently struck out at about a 30% clip since signing, he is probably not going to be an everyday player, or at the very least will be a flawed one if he is. Still, his control of the strike zone (chase rates historically in the mid-20s) and playable power (short to the ball, strong top hand through contact, hard-hit rates north of 40% throughout his early 20s, 113 mph max exit this year) are going to allow him to do some stuff on offense amid all the Ks, and that might be enough for Cauley to play short everyday. Defensive versatility will help maximize his impact, especially with the presence of other shortstops in this org. The high-end outcome for Cauley would look like what Chris Taylor's role and output was like during his peak. The disappointing outcome would be akin to what happened with Scott Kingery, though Cauley is a better athlete whose defense creates a higher floor than that.",,"sa3017167"

The Guards were fathoms deep on the middle infield (not just on the big league roster, but in the upper minors as well), but arguably thin at the positions Jones plays and light on his most prominent skill (power). Perhaps this is evidence that the Guards coveted Brito, who had a precocious, switch-hitting, contact-driven skill set similar to a lot of the players they target. Jones had a fantastic 2023 in Colorado while Brito had a solid season at mostly Double-A Akron, at least on offense. He slashed .276/.373/.444 there while seeing more time at third base than ever before. That's a rock solid line for a college-aged infielder in the upper levels of the minors, but some of Brito's underlying data is pedestrian (chase and power), and he hasn't progressed very much on defense, where he remains pretty bad. He has below average hands and range, and his exchange tends to be slow on double play attempts. Scouts are starting to say things like, ""He has a chance to stay at third base"" rather than, ""Let's hope this guy remains at 2B/SS,"" and when you put on the tape from Brito's 2023 winter league stint or from early 2024, he looks bigger and stronger but not any more mobile or deft on defense. It's what kept him just outside the overall Top 100. 
If Brito is going to be a corner infielder, or maybe even a left fielder, it will be more important for the OBP and power portions of his skill set to improve.

Unranked and evaluated as a 40 FV reliever at the time of the draft, Hackenberg got a hefty $2 million bonus as Atlanta's second round pick. 
Hack and the Braves have already altered his fastball usage, mixing a four-seamer in with his college sinker; the two pitches have radically different shapes. His fastball's velocity has been climbing throughout 2024; in late May, he was averaging 92-93, while in his last start prior to list publication, Hackenberg was sitting 93-95 deep into the game and touched 96. A lack of fastball effectiveness was part of why Hackenberg surrendered 113 hits in 85.1 innings as a sophomore, and development in this area is the chief reason why his FV grade has been elevated since he signed. Hackenberg's slurve was always excellent and continues to be. It sits in the 81-85 mph range and has power two-plane action. He also has a flat, terse cutter in the 86-89 mph range and an upper-80s changeup in the nascent stages of development. 
There are still some hurdles for Hackenberg to climb to comfortably profile as a starter, but he's already put himself in much better position to do so than at this time last year. If he can find a weapon designed to get lefties out (either via changeup development or a more frequent effort to get way over the top of his breaking ball to create depth), then we're talking about a no. 4 starter type who you'd find at the back of the Top 100.",,"sa3023304"

He worked 127.1 efficient innings (3.5 strikeout-to-walk ratio) in 2023, mostly at High-A Greensboro. His 2024 got off to a delayed start due to a rotator cuff strain, but Harrington has looked whole and effective since returning as he continues to throw plenty of strikes at Double-A Altoona. 
Harrington works with a pair of distinct fastballs and a power-sink changeup in the mid-80s. His ability to dot his fastball on the arm-side corner of the plate helps him set up his changeup to finish hitters off. His inability to do this for his slider via well-placed glove-side fastballs is still limiting his breaking ball's effectiveness. Hitters can eliminate half of the plate while they're facing Harrington, which might be an issue against big leaguers. The consistency of Harrington's release and his on-mound athleticism are attributes that make us want to project his command to be plus at maturity. That in concert with a good changeup is often enough to facilitate a backend starter role for any pitcher. We think that as Harrington experiments with different breaking ball shapes (which he seems to be so far this year), he'll find something that works and end up as a Dane Dunning type of starter.",,"sa3020752"

Prospect writing Yoda, Jim Callis, reported in April that Dax was likely to miss all of 2024. As is customary, Fulton's FV grade hasn't changed as a result of his TJ, but I've slid him to the back of his tier until he shows he's healthy again. 
Fulton's arm stroke is super short for such a tall pitcher, and this mechanical funk and the extreme downhill angle of his fastball combine to make him an uncomfortable at-bat. He commands two solid secondary pitches, the best of which is a breaking ball that spans the 78-84 mph range. His height and vertical arm slot give his fastball steep angle that runs counter to the flat-angled, bat-missing modern heater, but it takes hitters a few tries to get comfortable with it because of the unique look Fulton presents. His curveball also doesn't pop out of his hand — because he's so freaking big, it's always descending after it leaves the southpaw's fingertips — and it looks much more like his fastball out of the hand than is typical of pitchers with slower (by today's standards) breaking balls. This pitch can either miss a bat (it plays as a backfoot offering to righties), get a groundball (which Fulton does a lot of), or land in the zone for a strike. He can turn over the occasional average changeup and at least locate his change consistently.
Fulton is a relatively stiff athlete without the mechanical grace and ease that would typically lead one to project on the velocity, but even if this is all there ever is, Fulton is still of the no. 4/5 starter ilk, the sort on the fringe of making a contender's playoff rotation. He throws a starter's rate of strikes, his fastball has some non-traditional ""round up"" traits, he can bend in a nasty hook, and he'll hopefully get over this most recent injury and eat a ton of innings.",,"sa3014535"

Since then, he’s been plagued by injury, which has limited his play time significantly. But he stayed healthy all year in 2023 and nearly doubled what had previously been his highest innings total for a season, jumping from just 38.1 innings in 2022 to 86 innings in 2023 (both at High-A). 
He is on the shorter side for a pitcher, with very short arms even for his size, and he’s lowered his arm slot since being drafted, enhancing the deception he creates from his uphill lefty delivery, and making it difficult for hitters to adjust to it. His signature secondary is his curveball, which is cartoonishly slow – the kind of loopy offering Bugs Bunny would get three whiffs on before the ball reached the catcher. Even so, it features so much depth that while it’s relatively easy to identify out of his hand, its shape often prevents hitters from connecting with it. He uses his slider more often than the curveball – in fact, his slider usage has at times rivaled his fastball, with both sitting near 40%. The shape of the slider isn’t as impressive as that of the curveball, but it sits in the mid-80s, splitting the difference between his curve and his 92-94 mph fastball. With a low-80s changeup added to his arsenal, he is armed with a four-pitch mix with enough velocity separation to be very effective when Macko’s command is working for him. The command is inconsistent, though, and seeing as how the effectiveness of his mix depends on it, it's an area in need of major improvement if Macko wants to find his way into a big league starting rotation. Still, we think he's going to be a valuable weapon on a pitching staff even if he ends up as a long reliever. He's now on Toronto's 40-man roster, but it wouldn't surprise us if he spent his first option year entirely in the minors with an eye on increasing his per-outing and whole-season innings count.","2nbX61Y4TeM","sa3011555"

A career .298/.373/.478 hitter, Thompson was another of the many exciting bats who began 2023 at High-A Spokane and ended it at Double-A Hartford or beyond. He does not miss mistakes anywhere near the middle of the zone and sprays fastballs to both gaps, with Thompson most able to do extra-base damage by ambushing pullable pitches on the inner half. He tends to expand the zone and chase considerably more with two strikes, but in general Thompson is a skilled left-handed hitter to the eye. His underlying data mostly supports this, as his overall contact rate approached 80% in 2023. 
Thompson played second base and the outfield at Florida and had mostly played third and some 2B/OF as a pro before 2024, but since the end of spring training, he has split time between first base and left field, and he's more of a spray doubles hitter than the sort of thumper who is ideal at those spots. He's listed at 6-foot-3, 200 pounds but is rather slight of build. Can he still get stronger? One of the positives of Thompson's pre-draft profile was that he was young for a college prospect, and he's still just 22 as of list publication and already at Double-A. Limited power would mean Thompson's hit tool would need to be Daniel Murphyesque in order for him to be a foundational piece, and I don't have it projected to be quite that excellent. It's important for Thompson to find another gear of power in his mid-20s.

Knoth doesn't have prototypical starter's size but he's a superlative on-mound athlete with mechanics that are as repeatable as they are electric.

Injuries have been a frequent part of Millas' prospectdom. Dating back to college, he's had elbow, wrist, oblique and hip issues that have sidelined him at various points. He has the tools and skills of a primary backstop, but smaller-framed catchers like this tend to end up playing backup roles, especially if they've been injury prone. 
Millas is a plus catch-and-throw athlete with a great arm and amazing lateral quickness. He's a very rangy ball blocker and quickly recovers whatever he doesn't smother. He has a real knack for framing borderline pitches down in the zone. Millas' exchange is a little slow because he flips his hips and tries to have a clean, complete motion on every throw down, so he ""only"" posts average pop times even though his pure arm strength is plus. He used to throw from his knees quite often but that appears to have changed in 2023. Millas' 87 games caught last season was a career high for him, and he's closer to checking the box of durability. 
His biggest asset on offense is his feel for the strike zone, though Millas can also do some low-ball damage against breaking balls that don't quite finish. From the left-handed side, he employs a compact, contact-oriented, all-fields swing, while from the right side, his swing has a loftier path with more intent to elevate. He has a hole at the top of the zone big enough that big league pitchers will feel comfortable approaching him up there. With so much invested in Keibert Ruiz, and with the hard-swinging Riley Adams playing fairly well, the Nationals have a crowded group of young catchers on their 40-man. We think Millas has the look of a low-end regular or a premium backup, but because Ruiz is out of options and Adams has just one remaining, Millas is probably going to be stuck at Rochester unless the Nationals go out of their way to move one of the incumbents.",,"25643"

As impressive as McGonigle's physical tools are — he has plus bat-to-ball ability, surprising power for his size, and a plus arm — his on-field acumen and fundamentals also carry a ton of weight. He has fantastic baseball feel and instincts, a well-calibrated internal clock at shortstop, and he appears laser focused and competitive between the lines. Unless you're fearful that his present physicality is an indicator that he'll eventually be too bulky to move around on the middle infield, McGonigle is a slam dunk shortstop with enough contact ability and plate discipline to have average everyday shortstop upside and a good utilityman's floor. McGonigle is currently strong enough to do doubles damage in both gaps and to drop the bat head to golf out some pull-side homers, but his maxed-out build doesn't allow for much long-term power projection, which is why he's perceived to have a lower ceiling.",,"sa3022895"

For the last two seasons, ERC has been on an upward trajectory in terms of his velocity and innings count. He rather impressively held his own as a teenage starter in full-season ball last year before he was shut down with elbow inflammation. Elmer was sitting 92 and mixing in three secondary offerings.

Rodriguez-Cruz repeats his mechanics with impressive consistency for a young pitcher his size and is one of the higher probability starter prospects in this system even though he's so young. Basically everything you could have hoped for when ERC was drafted is coming to fruition. He's parlayed his curveball feel into other good breaking balls (there's a slider or cutter here, or possibly both) that top out around 89 mph, and he continues to have changeup projection because of his loose, whippy arm action.

Culpepper lacks an overt platoon-neutralizer, but his repertoire is otherwise a lot like Zebby's. He throws a lot of well-located cutters in on the hands of lefties and tries to rush his heater past guys at the letters. His slider has enough depth that it can be used as a backfoot weapon against lefties to get a chase, but he has to nail the location for it to be effective, whereas Matthews' vertical fastball/curveball split is more dramatic and gives him better margin for error in this regard. That's virtually the only thing separating these two and you could easily prefer Culpepper because of the way his body's put together. A few of our sources pointed to Culpepper as a candidate to be a Top 100 Prospect this offseason.

The injury cost him his junior season, but his pre-injury look was exciting enough for the Giants to select him 30th overall in 2022. He was developed as a two-way player through 2023, making short starts every five days with one DH appearance in between. He totalled just 19 innings before going to the Fall League, where he had one last gasp as a hitter; Crawford has plus power but his bat is often too late to make contact. He's being developed solely as a pitcher in 2024. 
Crawford began the season in extended spring training (you can see his recent outing there in the linked video), where he was throwing hard (95-98) but not with the all-world gas we saw before his injury. His heater has huge uphill tailing action that he doesn't always command, while his curveball (78-81 mph during his Arizona tune up) has superlative two-plane break and is going to be a lethal pitch. Crawford's changeup also has bat-missing action at times, but as with his fastball, it often tails into unpredictable locations. 
Crawford's 40-man platform year is 2025, so realistically the Giants have through 2026 or so to build his innings count and help him polish his repertoire and command enough to start. He entered 2024 having thrown just 19 professional innings, and he's only been both healthy and focusing on pitching for a couple of months. We love tip-of-the-iceberg types like Crawford, whose career context gives us a reason to project on his skills. Stiff, muscular, and approaching bulky, Crawford doesn't move with the fluidity of a typical big league starter, and it's more likely he ends up pitching toward the back of a bullpen than the top or middle of a good rotation, but because of his career context it makes sense for the Giants to see if he's only scratching the surface of his potential command. He's still graded here on par with a late first rounder.","388V-R84ei8","sa3020457"

His fastball lives in the low-to-mid-90s and has enough life to play as a bat-misser when he locates it to the up and arm-side locations where it plays best. Tidwell's changeup has promising movement and velocity separation from his fastball, but he still doesn't command it consistently. If you recall, Tidwell was a draft-eligible sophomore who missed time in college due to a shoulder ailment. He has pitched less than most prospects his age and I've tended to project late growth for his changeup based on his lack of reps and delivery/athleticism. I'm still inclined to do that despite the stagnation there. Tidwell's delivery is a bit violent, he had the shoulder issue, and until early 2024, he has had middling control. There's a little more relief risk here than the typical no. 4/5 starter profile, so I've rounded down on Tidwell's grade a bit to account for that.

The violence and inconsistency of his delivery caused him to project as a reliever on our draft rankings, but he's been developed as a starter so far and has outperformed that pre-draft expectation through Double-A. As a 22-year-old in his first year of full-season ball, he tossed 114.2 frames and finished with a 3.30 ERA, 137 strikeouts (10.8/9 IP) and 50 walks (3.9/9 IP). 
When you watch Barnett you can definitely see relief risk in his delivery (mostly in the plunge and length in his arm path), but he rolls four pitches deep, he's athletic and very powerfully built for a 6-foot guy, and he's thrown starter's strikes so far. His four-seam fastball sits 93-96 mph and Barnett has shown he can reach back for a tick more on occasion. He features two breaking balls: A slider that's a sharp 84-87 mph two-plane breaker and a curveball that's a deep 12-to-6er that doesn't quite match the same level of authority in its break as the slider does. Barnett also has a firm changeup that ranges from 85-88 mph and often lacks effective movement, but he'll throw enough that flash late depth and fade to warrant optimism it will eventually become an average pitch for him. His pitching style is relatively inefficient, but even at his size, Barnett has been chugging along from the moment he was put in a rotation.

The Cardinals have tried to shift Saggese up the defensive spectrum and he's playing more shortstop for them at Memphis in 2024 than he ever did for the Rangers. He actually looks pretty good there despite lacking the high-end physical ability typically associated with that position (like arm strength), largely because his exchange is so clean and quick. Saggese's feel to hit has been the lynchpin of his prospectdom since high school. As a smaller guy, it requires a ton of effort for him to swing hard, but he does a remarkable job of tracking the baseball despite this. His hit tool is probably going to play below Saggese's bat control talent due to his tendency to expand the zone, and without that carrying quite as much weight as it has in the minors, Saggese is more likely to be a well-rounded utilityman than an everyday player.",,"27883"

Considering that and how hastily Hernaiz has been promoted by Baltimore (who traded him for Cole Irvin) and Oakland, his .290/.356/.418 career line in the minors is quite impressive. Hernaiz spent 2023 split between Double- and Triple-A and performed very well (133 wRC+ at Midland, 97 wRC+ in Vegas) considering he was the age of a college prospect. He has had a consistent and impressive bat-to-ball performance through the minors, with strikeout rates in the 15-17% range at every level. 
Hernaiz's best swings are electrifying. He's an explosive rotational athlete with impressive power for a 22-year-old infielder. So why not a bigger evaluation here? Hernaiz is fairly chase-prone and his bat path takes forever to get into the hitting zone. He tends to be late against velocity and either drive the ball the other way or swing through it entirely, and a lot of his contact comes on the ground. Combine this with a fairly high chase rate, and Hernaiz will have to make some adjustments in order to hit like an impact big leaguer. On defense, he has the speed and range to play shortstop, but his hands are inconsistent and he has a non-traditional throwing stroke. Most shortstops get on top of the baseball when they throw, especially on throws from the hole, while Hernaiz's arm stroke tends to be long and low. 
There's a ton of physical ability here (led by the bat speed and plate coverage) and Hernaiz is still very young. The situation in Oakland is such that he'll be given a ton of runway to develop at the big league level. He's effectively being asked to re-learn third base (where he last played regularly while he was an Orioles prospect) and deal with major league-quality pitching after just one whole season above A-ball. Things are probably going to be ugly for a little while (he’s hitting .194/.261/.194 with a 41 wRC+ as of list publication), but Hernaiz could turn into an Ezequiel Duran type whose versatility and power drive an impactful profile despite his other flaws.","R2Sr_17ruBs","26224"

It takes him so much effort and time to get the bat going that Crawford often drives the ball into the ground and to the opposite field. It takes him so much effort and time to get the bat going that Crawford often drives the ball into the ground and to the opposite field. His spray chart looks like that of Takuya Nakashima, with his groundball rate hovering around 70% in 2023. For comparison, the qualified hitter with the highest 2023 GB% was Tim Anderson at 61%. There's a ton of work to be done here to get Crawford's swing and strength to a big league-worthy spot. 
That's not to say he's a bad prospect. When Crawford swings, the bend and athleticism in his lower half is amazing. Despite his physical immaturity, he doesn't whiff a ton, and there's a dynamic gap-to-gap hitter lurking here. Crawford is also a plus-plus runner who could be an impact center field defender with time. This package of contact, speed, and defense is exciting if you anticipate that more strength will come, but it's imperative that it does.

He was peaking in the 97-99 mph range early on, then was sitting in the upper 80s during his final two starts of the season. He is so slight of build (Triston McKenzie is a fair frame/body comp) that there was concern Mazur would have long-term issues holding his peak velocity as a starter throughout a full pro season. Mazur held a 93-96 mph fastball across 96 innings in 2023, finishing his season at Double-A San Antonio. He coasted through Double- and Triple-A during the first half of 2024 before making his big league debut a few weeks prior to this update. 
Mazur's walk rate has exploded in the big leagues. He never walked more than 1.89 batters per nine innings at any minor league level and suddenly his big league mark is over five. It's fair to have some long-term questions about the viability of Mazur's repertoire at the big league level. His fastball is his only chase pitch because both of his breaking balls tend to finish in the strike zone. His arm slot makes it tough for him to create two-plane break on his slider, so while his best ones are still pretty nasty, they tend not to turn the corner and finish off the plate. Mazur will probably need to pitch backwards a lot of the time in order to survive. His fastball is getting tagged in the strike zone and he's surrendering a 94% z-contact rate against the pitch as of publication. His arm strength and breaking ball quality ensure he's going to be a useful big leaguer, but the Mazur we've seen in the majors looks more like a future reliever.",,"31900"

His velocity climbed throughout the 2021 and 2022 seasons, with Arrighetti throwing four ticks harder than he did in college by the end of that span. That velo spike was sustained (but plateaued) in 2023 even as the Astros took the piggyback starter leash off and Arrighetti consistently worked five innings or more. This year, he’s added a cutter to his fastball/sweeper mix and debuted (but struggled) in the big leagues, to the tune of a 5.33 ERA (3.84 FIP) as of list publication. 
Arrighetti’s fastball tails and rides in on the hands of right-handed hitters, while his sweeper breaks in the exact opposite direction. His breaking ball command is better than his fastball command, which is part of why we have him on the starter/reliever line. Considering how loose and whippy his delivery is, and that this level of velocity is relatively new for him, it’s plausible Arrighetti could sharpen his command enough to more comfortably project as a starter. His fastball plays up because of huge extension (look how far down the mound he is at release in his video), and he might not even need precise command of that pitch to bully hitters in the zone with it because of the way it jumps on them. Really what Arrighetti has needed is a more reliable way to thwart left-handed hitters, and while the new cutter definitely gives opposing hitters something else to parse, we're not sure it’s going to be a panacea against lefties. Arrighetti also has a changeup that he barely uses, and the way he tends to approach lefties is by altering the shape of his slower breaking ball to make it more vertical, like a curveball. 
As we’ve seen with 30-year-old Ronel Blanco and his new changeup, Houston can teach an old dog new tricks, and it’s plausible Arrighetti will find yet another gear with big league instruction. He’s needed as a starter right now due to injury, but, even though our FV grade for him has now gone up a tier, on a healthy, contending team’s roster, this guy is probably a multi-inning reliever.",,"29921"

His stocky build lacks great long-term physical projection (Omar Narvaez and Tucker Barnhart are pretty good body comps), but Laverde already has good offensive tools for a catching prospect. He also has a good arm, but his poor receiving (Laverde frequently flinches when hitters swing and loses sight of the baseball) needs to improve if he's going to stay back there. So much of Laverde's upside is dependent on him developing as a catcher and if our degree of confidence in him staying back there was higher, he'd be in the 40+ FV tier.

His rehab was interrupted by an ill-timed foot fracture, which kept him off the mound until midway through the 2023 season, after which old co-workers Kenny Williams and Kim Ng swapped Jake Burger for Eder at the trade deadline. When he returned, it was with a lower arm slot, and Eder struggled to recapture the arm strength from before his injury, as his fastball sat in the 92-94 mph neighborhood during the 2023 regular season and again in the Arizona Fall League. 
His fastball still has some top-of-the-zone whiff ability thanks to its shape and angle, but that pitch isn't nearly as dominant as it was before he blew out. His slider is still a stunner, however, bending in at 77-81 mph with plus-plus break. Eder was clearly working on his changeup, especially after the trade and in the Fall League, where he used it in a left-on-left capacity a lot of the time. He has starter-quality feel for locating his changeup, though it still needs to fully develop from a movement standpoint. It's a bit discouraging that Eder's velocity didn't totally return after TJ, as it's often the first thing to be fully restored for most pitchers.

He has tallied more minor league strikeouts than any other pitcher since 2022. McDermott has impact stuff but his arms-and-legs delivery is very difficult for him to corral, and he's walked 14% of opposing hitters during that span. McDermott has a huge wingspan and creates plus extension, which helps his heater jump on hitters. It also contributes to the inconsistency of his arm swing and is part of why he sprays his fastball all over the place and isn't a lock to remain a starter. It's possible that, even at 25, McDermott is still growing into his lever length and that starter-level feel for location will come with time, but he remains far from that reality right now in his 40-man evaluation year. 
Don't get it twisted — McDermott is going to be an impact arm of some kind. He sits 94 with flat angle and ride, and has two nasty breaking balls — a 75-78 mph curveball and 82-85 mph slider — that have utility versus both lefties and righties. It might be good for him to throw the slider more often since he appears to have the most consistent feel for locating that pitch.

His father played basketball at St. Francis College and Lalane accrued experience at PG tournaments in the US when he was a child. He didn't commit to pitching until he was 14-years old. A half decade later, Lalane dominated the complex level across a meager 21.1 innings in 2023, with 34 strikeouts and just four walks. He made about a start per week throughout July and most of August, working three or four innings at most. That's important context through which to view Lalane's impressive stuff, and an important thing to know as it pertains to his developmental timeline. The Yankees have two seasons to get him in position for a 40-man add (he's Rule 5 eligible after the 2025 season), and he has a real shot to earn a spot immediately. That means upping his innings count considerably over the next two years (we can probably ballpark Lalane at something like a combined 45 innings between extended spring/FCL/backfield work in 2023) to get him in position to be a rosterable 40-man guy at age 21. 
We're going to learn a lot about Lalane's ability to handle that in 2024, when he'll likely go to full-season ball for the first time. His fastball averaged 93-94 mph on the complex and he tended to live in the 91-95 mph range during his longer outings. There are a lot of young A.J. Puk (body) and Dax Fulton (everything) similarities happening here. Lalane has advanced strike-throwing ability across his repertoire. His delivery is balanced and graceful for an athlete his size, his whole operation hurdles his body toward the plate, and he routinely locates his fastball and changeup where he wants. At this size, it's plausible Lalane could continue to throw harder as he gets stronger, and he's probably going to need to in order to have a bat-missing fastball because, like Fulton, the downhill trajectory of Lalane's fastball causes it to play down. His entire skill set is more about feel and command than nasty pure stuff right now. I'm projecting that there will eventually be a finishing breaking ball here because the ball doesn't pop out of hand from Lalane's release point, but for now, he just has a looking-strike curveball. In a typical draft, a guy like Lalane is going in the comp round or early second, with Fulton acting as a fantastic barometer in this regard, and I have his FV grade centered in that area. His ceiling is going to be dictated by the velocity he can develop during the next two years or so.",,"sa3016066"

A transfer from UNC Wilmington, Groover raked for two years at NC State but was a mistake-prone third base defender. He has rare hand speed and demonstrated plus rates of contact at NC State and then in 100 PAs at High-A Hillsboro after the draft, where he struck out just 9% of the time. He might be a swing tweak away from a huge offensive breakout. Groover's swing isn't always connected and it can look awkward when he's slicing down at low pitch, but his hands rip through the zone in the blink of an eye and his contact rates are shockingly good for how hard he swings. He is a very dangerous hitter to all fields and was only vulnerable to swings and misses at NC State when he would chase, which wasn't often. His feel for the zone was evident after the draft as well. On defense, Groover often looks rushed and his throws frequently pull the first baseman off the bag, but his range and overall athleticism give him huge long-term ceiling with the glove if those issues can be ironed out. He got hurt playing first base, which he's new to. 
Groover's profile is magmatic, and a lot of it still might shift and change. The core of it — his combo of bat-to-ball feel and bat speed — gives him an everyday player's projection if he can tap into the pop. He's a 2024 Arizona Fall League candidate.",,"sa3022887"

He spent 2021 on the complex in Arizona, then toured several universities in Texas with the Rangers' Instructional League squad that was facing college teams in fall scrimmages. Those scrimmages were mostly scouted by folks in amateur departments who were there to evaluate Baylor and Texas Tech more than they were Rangers prospects. Teodo came out sitting 98-101 mph, blowing the minds of scouts sifting through an ocean of college guys sitting 92. 
Since then, Teodo has pitched admirably as a starter all the way to Double-A Frisco. He has consistently posted the same strikeout (31-33%) and walk rates (12%) at every level. Because of his size and below-average control, it's very likely that Teodo will end up pitching in relief, but his stuff is so good that he might be a closer. He's sitting 97-99 and has touched 102 as a starter while working as many as 84 innings in a single season, a mark he's poised to blow through this year. If there's a reason to be more optimistic about Teodo starting, it's that his delivery doesn't have the NC-17 violence that is typically required for someone his size to throw this hard. But what seals the relief projection for me here is Teodo's fastball shape, which is more tail-oriented and is yielding contact rates that are much higher than is typical against a fastball this hard. I buy he's a starter-quality athlete, but he's still going to be a rather inefficient operator. 
Teodo's best sliders are better than his best fastballs. They average 88 mph and spin at roughly 2,800 rpm. His ability to land the pitch for a strike is superior to that of his fastball by a pretty wide margin, and Teodo might even take a slider-first approach if he's put in the bullpen. I have Teodo throwing changeups 6% of the time as of list publication. It's not a terrible offering because hitters are so geared up his fastball, and I'd like to see him use it more to really give it a shot at developing.

For instance, Martínez often swings so hard that his ill-fitting helmet careens off his head in the middle of his hack. He's also more comfortable throwing from body positions typical at second base than he is on the left side of the infield, where he often either throws across his body or has to take a few steps to set himself before getting the baseball over there.

He often swings underneath high fastballs as a left-handed hitter and might struggle to maintain above-average rates of contact as he faces big league velocity. He's likely to be a well-rounded utility infielder without a true plus tool.","scyNozmYU7Y","26540"

He slashed .318/.426/.549 throughout his college career in Springfield, had as many walks as strikeouts, and posted a 51% hard-hit rate (Missouri State plays in the same stadium as the Cardinals' Double-A team, so it's fitted with all the tech) in a pretty sizable sample as a junior. As a pro, Baldwin has posted an OPS above .750 and generated above-average offense at every level en route to a Double-A assignment to start 2024, most of it driven by his OBP. I'm skeptical about Baldwin's on-base ability continuing to play quite like it has so far. Baldwin's chase rate with two strikes has tended to be much higher than in other counts, which is an indication of premeditated takes early in at-bats. That gap (25% overall chase, 37% with two strikes) is not as big so far in 2024 as it was in 2023 (25% and a rather elevated 44%, respectively), but it's still meaningful. 
Baldwin's contact rates are very exciting — 83% in the zone in 2023 and approaching 90% so far in 2024. The short-levered lefty swings hard and rotates with verve for a player his size, and he tends to pepper the opposite field gap. It's rare for him to turn and burn extra-base hits to his pull side, especially against fastballs. His offense projects to be well-rounded and competent for a big league catcher, but it lacks an impact skill unless you believe his plate discipline is going to map to the majors without a dip. 
Baldwin has made impressive developmental progress on defense. The Braves drastically altered some stylistic elements of his receiving, most notably paring down Baldwin's footwork and putting him more regularly on one knee, and it has taken Baldwin some time to get comfortable with that. His receiving and ball blocking are still only fair, in part because of Baldwin's lack of size and strength, but the quickness and consistency of his exchange on throws to second base has gotten much better. Baldwin's skills are approaching that of an average primary catcher, but his lack of size and my apprehension about taking his OBP skills at face value has me forecasting him as more of a second-division regular. He was promoted to Triple-A Gwinnett just before list publication.",,"sa3019920"

His final season ended with a Tommy John. He returned from surgery in time to throw 18.1 innings in 2023, his first season in pro ball, and he struck out 28 batters over those limited frames while only walking six. 
His delivery gives hitters a low-slot look with above-average deception because of how well his arm circle hides the ball, as well as there being generalized funk in the movements of his delivery. His fastball sits in the 92-94 mph range (which is up from before he got hurt) and frequently plays above that, though more because of his deception than outlier life or movement. Barco manipulates the shape on his 81-85 mph slider between a three-quarter, short tilting version and a sweepy, two-plane breaker that he uses more to get swing-and-miss out of the zone. He does a good job of mimicking his fastball arm speed when throwing his changeup, which has fade and depth to it and ranges from 83-86 mph. He also recently added a splitter that plays more vertical and has slight bottom action that occurs later than the changeup’s movement. He threw a split in high school that was exciting at the time and we think it will again be a meaningfully good pitch for Barco, who also looks noticeably stronger than when he was in college. 
There’s more start-by-start variance in Barco's command than is ideal for a starter prospect whose stuff requires him to have feel for location, but he's only just back from TJ. He projects as a high-floor no. 4/5 starter.",,"sa3022409"

The added velocity came with (and was likely because of) a full-time move to the bullpen, and Rodriguez posted a 1.15 ERA in his 54 innings. Then Rodriguez pitched for Cuba's 2023 WBC team as a starter. After a rough-looking February tuneup before the actual competition began, he was nasty across 65-to-70 pitches in each of his two WBC starts, when Yariel sat 95, touched 98, and bent in a good vertical breaking ball in the 83-87 mph range. After his WBC performance, Rodriguez chose to opt out of the 2023 NPB season and focus on training to come to MLB the following year. Chunichi put him on the restricted list and Rodriguez wasn’t heard from until October, when he threw live BP for teams in the Dominican Republic and looked like his usual self. 
There may be teams that view Rodriguez as a potential MLB starter because of his repertoire depth and brief success in the WBC, but hold your horses. He started for multiple seasons in Japan and wasn't very good, with a FIP near 5.00 in 2021 prompting a bullpen move the following year. He only came into impact velocity once he moved to the 'pen and there is zero evidence that he'd be able to sustain it as a starter, in fact quite the contrary. As a relief candidate, Rodriguez is exciting and has the stuff to pitch in higher-leverage innings. His vertical fastball/breaking ball combo looks similar to Peter Fairbanks' stuff (minus a few ticks of velo) and is on par with the second- or third- best reliever coming out of a contender's bullpen.","kFqDEzmdPrc","33838"

He's a potential everyday center fielder who does a little bit of everything, and I currently have him FV'd in line with a typical mid-to-late first round teenage draft prospect. 
Twitchy, sinewy, and relatively projectable, Reyes is a converted amateur infielder (per a scout) who has a promising early-career look in center field. He ran right around 4.2 during my week of looks, which is a tick above average for a lefty batter, and he should add some speed as he matures athletically. His reads and routes out there are fine — he nearly made one sensational play on a ball hit directly over his head, but he couldn't keep the ball in his glove as he leapt and crashed onto the warning track. Reyes is a skilled hitter who tracks pitches and moves the baseball all over the field. I watched him hit a pull-side homer and a single on a drag bunt in the same game the week prior to list publication, and make in-flight adjustments to breaking stuff that he lined over the infielder's heads. On paper in 2023 he performed right there with the big league average in center field, with a 75% overall contact rate and 85% rate in the zone.

He is quickly marching to the big leagues and could arrive in the middle of 2024 given the amount of starter turnover ahead of him in the Brewers org. 
When Gasser is really humming, he's dotting backdoor breaking balls and driving hitters mad by mixing uphill fastballs and cutters up around their hands. While he doesn't throw especially hard, his low arm slot gives him some ability to climb the ladder with his fastball and miss bats even at 91-94 mph, though this approach is probably going to make him prone to fly balls and homers. Our fear that righties are going to tee off on his fastball was enough to keep Gasser off the Top 100 prospects list and has us projecting him more as a contender's backend starter who probably gets shifted into the bullpen in the playoffs. 
During the regular season, Gasser's skills are still going to be very valuable. He has a master's degree in pitch sequencing and the east/west command to weaponize it. His slider has big, lengthy sweep, and his fastballs and cutters interact with one another in ways that confound hitters and cause a lot of awkward swings. Gasser's changeup has not developed as we would typically hope/project for such an athletic and loose lefty, which is another reason we slid him below the cut line of the Top 100 even though he dominated Triple-A in 2023. All of his good pitches have glove-side action except the two-seam variant of Gasser's fastball, which is pretty vulnerable when located to his arm side.

Without the benefit of context, you could reasonably be inclined to absolutely whack him here. His in-zone contact rates are south of 70% and many of his swings look totally disconnected and awkward. For the last couple of years, Vaquero has arguably been the prospect with the widest range of possible outcomes in pro baseball. He is built like an NFL wide receiver prospect at an extremely projectable 6-foot-3, 180 pounds, and he not only had the most traditionally projectable frame in his entire 2022 amateur class, but arguably has the best frame of any prospect to enter pro baseball since Elly De La Cruz. The mere possibility that Vaquero could end up as a powerful, switch-hitting center fielder separated him from most of the prospect population even though he had Schrödinger's Hit Tool. This is a little bit different than Erick Peña and Robert Puason because Vaquero is overtly explosive in every way, he just lacks any modicum of feel to hit, especially from the left side. Indeed, he may be a candidate to scrap switch-hitting at some point in the next couple of years. 
Everything else Vaquero does is incredibly exciting. When he runs into one, he has uncommon power for a hitter his age, he runs close to 4.00 flat from the left side, and he has a huge arm. Even if he can have a 30 hit tool, so long as Vaquero is getting to power and playing center field, he's going to be a good big leaguer. His ball skills need polish, but he has the range to play center, though Elijah Green has been taking the lion's share of the center field reps at Fredericksburg so far in 2024. The Nationals have nothing to do but give Vaquero all the runway they can to let him develop.

He sat just 92 in his most recent big league start but averaged 95 in his most recent minor league start prior to list publication, the latter on 10 days of rest. Hancock has a command-driven sinker/changeup profile. His low arm slot doesn't allow his slider to finish consistently and some of them have cutter shape at slider velocities.

Melton reworked his arm action, had a great fourth year as an Aztec, and climbed into the fourth round of the 2022 draft. Melton was mostly drafted because he has a live arm and his mechanical adjustments made his fastball less hittable; the Tigers were tasked with developing the rest. They've begun to. Melton made substantial alterations to his slider in 2023, as the pitch picked up roughly five ticks of velocity compared to his college breaker. At times, it has devastating two-plane sweep. 
There are an awful lot of late-bloomer traits here, as Melton was young for his graduating class, was mostly a catcher in high school, missed a season due to the pandemic, and now has a fairly new delivery and a very new breaking ball. I love Melton's bounding, down-the-mound mechanics and his athleticism (big lower half bend and hip/shoulder separation here), and I think he may just be scratching the surface as a craftsman. Even though there are pitchers with similar or currently better stuff who are closer to the big leagues, I consider Melton's chances of holding down a rotation spot for a contender down the road to be greater.

The little low-three-quarters righty looked like a Vance Worley starter kit last year, but his secondary pitches and velocity have both taken a meaningful leap compared to 2023 and Paez has retained his incredible command in the process. Paez is an east/west artist and rarely misses in hittable locations. He'll bury his sinker in spots that make it impossible to elevate, run it back over the corner of the plate for a strike, set up his excellent changeup with precise arm-side location, and occasionally run his heater up the ladder where it can slip past certain hitters' bats because of its angle. Paez's slider is much harder this year than last, averaging 82 mph, up four ticks from 2023. His ability to attack with lateral fastball/slider divergence and then pull the string with his changeup is so advanced that Paez could probably be pitching at Double-A right now. His cross-bodied delivery requires a fair bit of effort for the little righty to execute, but Paez is a fantastic athlete and has never had strike-throwing issues. This is one of the few prospects in the minors who has a chance to develop elite, 80-grade command and could be a mid-rotation starter despite his relative lack of size and velocity.",,"sa3016264"

Raya's fastball is sitting 94-96 mph, but he’s struggled mightily to generate whiffs in the zone with it against Double-A hitters; some of that seems to be because there’s a lack of deception in his delivery, which looks easy to time. His mid-to-upper-80s slider projects to plus with its sharp two-plane and downer shapes; it has had no issues missing bats, especially against righties. The changeup, with it’s limited action and velocity separation (87-90 mph), continues to lag behind the rest of Raya's arsenal, but he’s added a cutter this year to go along with his vertical curveball to better combat left-handers. The curveball is a deep 12-to-6 breaker that shows above-average tightness and, at 80-84 mph, offers a significant separation in pace from his fastball. Raya’s new cutter is short but quick, and will serve as a pitch to stay off barrels rather than completely miss them.

Sproat tends to sit 94-98 mph, and his sinking, upper-80s changeup is easily plus. He has reshaped his breaking ball as a pro and is now throwing a sweeper-shaped slider in the 82-85 mph range. He's not using it a ton as of yet, but it has the potential to be a separator for him. Slider consistency was Sproat's biggest issue at Florida and it looks as though the Mets have helped him make an adjustment there. They've also altered his arm slot. Sproat was a cross-bodied, lower-slot guy in college, but he's a little less cross-bodied now and is throwing from more of a three-quarters slot, giving his fastball rise/run shape rather than the sink/tail of his college days. He's not yet comfortable locating his fastball to the parts of the zone where its new movement plays best, but this should theoretically help it miss more bats than his college version did. These attributes are still new enough that even though Sproat was already promoted to Double-A, I wouldn't consider him on the fast track to the bigs until the dust settles on some of these tweaks.

He experienced a two-tick bump in 2023 and began integrating more secondary pitches before he was shut down in April with back and rib injuries. 
Gigantic 6-foot-8 frames like this ordinarily create whiff-diluting downhill plane on the fastball, but Tredwell's does a ton of damage in the zone at 91-93 because he's generating roughly 20 inches of vertical break from about seven feet of extension. He isn't the sort of twitchy athlete who you expect to throw harder over time, but this fastball will play. Curveballs and sliders were more a part of Tredwell's formula starting in 2023. His 75-80 mph curveball is a deep 12-to-6 downer that regularly shows above-average tightness. At its best, the slider has two-plane action ending in late tilt, but it's an offering he tends to get on the side of, morphing its shape into a tweener breaking ball with a bit less authority in its bite. Both breakers are about average in quality and play down because Tredwell doesn't locate them. The changeup rounds out his arsenal. It's an offering he throws less than 10% of the time; more often than not, it has minimal effective action and at best projects to be a “show-me” pitch long-term. With his curveball as vertical as it is, he may not need the changeup to be an average offering for him to neutralize left-handed hitters.  
Tredwell's feel to pitch needs to improve. He has a power-over-precision operation right now, but remember he was in the bullpen or injured for a lot of his college career. For this reason, he also hasn't proven he can eat a buffet's worth of innings yet, but his frame indicates it's possible. We really like Tredwell's foundation of positive fastball traits to go along with a projectable frame and underdeveloped career arc, which could easily result in late-arriving command or even more velocity in the future. A long relief or swingman role is his realistic outcome, with some no. 4 starter high-end possibility if the components we've talked about here develop as hoped.",,"sa3023524"

Similar to Dodgers outfielder James Outman, McCray's uppercut style of swinging leaves him very vulnerable at the top of the strike zone, with his barrel breezing below a lot of pitches up there. His strikeout rate has typically hovered around the 30% mark in the minors, which is actually more substantial than Outman's was at the same time, and it'd be surprising if he developed better than a 30-grade hit tool. Lithe and lean, McCray's swing packs a surprising punch for a guy with his build, and he's a very dangerous low-ball, pull-side hitter. His style of swing should enable him to get to his power when he's making contact. Combine that with electric center field defense and McCray should be a solid extra outfielder. He's getting his first taste of Double-A to start 2024. Though he isn't necessarily young for the level, McCray was a multi-sport high schooler whose would-be first full season was squashed by the pandemic.

Joyce missed time in 2023 due to ulnar neuritis, which limited him to 27.2 total innings (10 in the bigs). He throws from a three-quarters slot with plus-plus arm speed. He appears healthy this spring (he was sent to Double-A), as he's once again sitting 99 and peaking above that, but he's hindered a bit by his erratic control and tick-below-average deception. Joyce’s slider will show sharp two-plane action, and he also throws a version with more length to it; both shapes are able to consistently maintain their above-average bite. Joyce has improved his ability to land the breaking ball in the zone, and he'll need to continue to make strides in that regard for the offering to have above-average effectiveness long-term and not be overly reliant on chase.

Morales also has explosive power to his pull side and can already put balls out to dead center field at age 17. Unlike a lot of lanky teenage hitters, Morales' bat-to-ball performance in amateur events was statistically strong. On film, his hands have a late, deep move that I worry will make him late against pro velocity, but it's too early to care much about that. Morales bends well for an athlete of his size and build, and he has a decent shot to stay at shortstop. While he's a skill fit there, it's plausible that sheer size will force him to move in his early-to-mid-20s.

Namely, Gonzalez's swing and the way he plays defense are both atypical of an impact big leaguer. After three seasons in the SEC, Jacob wrapped his career with a .319/.427/.561 career line and 30 more total walks than strikeouts. This level of statistical performance in the SEC is rare, and Gonzalez was barely 21 on draft day. This is usually the sort of prospect we're tripping over ourselves to value, but Gonzalez's swing had a huge hole at the top of the zone that Eric feared would be exploited in pro ball. He could be Bryson Stott (who had similar swing questions in college), or he could be JJ Bleday (ditto, and still he crushed the SEC). 
Gonzalez also didn't become meaningfully stronger in college, and in fact regressed a bit as an athlete during his time in Oxford. By the time he was underway for instructs in Arizona, his body and swing were both clearly starting to change. He looked buff in the fall, and while we don't yet know what impact these swing tweaks will have, we at least know Gonzalez is open to change and making good in the weight room. His hands, actions, quick transfer, internal clock, and arm accuracy all made him a likely pro shortstop despite him lacking the traditional speed/range and max-effort arm of a big league shortstop, but now that Gonzalez's physicality has begun to change, he might take a leap in those areas. Skinny Jacob often needed to wind up his whole body in order to swing hard, but now that he looks stronger, he may not have to make the mechanical concessions that left him vulnerable at the belt. This is an important baseball-wide prospect to monitor early in 2024 in order to gauge the impact of these changes, because Gonzalez has the underlying skill set to break out in a big way if they cure some of what we perceived to be his pre-draft ills.",,"sa3022498"

He was always pretty likely to spend all of 2024 in the minors because of his raw control, but it was imperative for the Rays to 40-man him because his stuff is so good that a team probably would have taken him in the Rule 5 Draft and put him in their big league bullpen. 
The 'pen is Curet's likely destination anyway, because his stuff is simply too explosive for him to corral. He sits 95-98 and will touch 99 with huge rise-and-run life that often causes his fastball to sail up out of the zone. Curet's slider is a vicious two-plane breaker with huge depth for a pitch that sits about 87. It's possible Curet also has a cutter, because he throws pitches at cutter speeds (up to 91) with much different, shorter movement than his finish-in-the-dirt sliders, but it's also possible this is just a manifestation of his release inconsistency. This guy has had some dominant starts and it makes sense for the Rays to continue to let Curet develop as a starter for another year (the 2025 season will be his second option year). He'd need to show both greatly improved command and a third, consistent pitch in order to profile as a starter by 2026, which feels like a big ask. That hasn't really tempered our enthusiasm for Curet as a prospect because he might have elite fastball velocity in single-inning relief.

Sanchez has a dynamic and beautiful left-handed swing that combines natural loft and barrel precision to give him one of the better present offensive toolsets in his class.

A former two-way player who was just returned from a June hamstring injury, Brannigan's surface stats look pretty mediocre so far this season, but his underlying data is strong. He's making a roughly average rate of contact and producing peak exit velocities in line with the big league average, which is an exciting combination for a potentially viable shortstop. 
It's often the case that eyeball scouting reports will reinforce the underlying data even when a guy isn't performing on the surface, but that has not been the case for Brannigan, who our scouting sources tend not to like very much. Their issues frequently lie with his defense. While Brannigan's hands can be inconsistent, he checks the boxes for range and athleticism, and he has an absolute hose. Yes, Brannigan is 23, but he hasn't focused solely on being a position player for very long, and we think he might have late projection in this area that allows him to end up a cleaner fit at shortstop than some of the industry believes. 
On offense, Brannigan's swing looks like it will be vulnerable to good velocity as he climbs the minors. He hasn't yet reached Double-A, so we should take his contact performance with a grain of salt. Brannigan loads his hands low and his swing is geared for extreme lift. We think this means he'll cut underneath a lot of big league fastballs, but we also think this style of hitting will help Brannigan get to most of his power anyway. We're stopping short of projecting Brannigan as a potential everyday player even though we could see how you might conclude that if you just look at the TrackMan spreadsheet.

Mejia has one of the more beautiful and athletic deliveries in the minors, as well as an ideal pitcher's frame at a lanky, broad-shouldered 6-foot-3. Mejia's velocity has climbed into the upper 90s across the last couple of seasons and he tends to coast in the 95-97 mph range with peaks around 100. His slider is arguably a better pitch, as it has massive two-planed wipe in the 83-87 mph band. That pitch has enough movement to freeze hitters when Mejia wants to throw it for a strike, and enough to miss a bat when he locates it for a chase, which he does pretty consistently even though his fastball command is poor. When you include Synergy's 2023 and 2024 samples, Mejia's slider is generating chase and miss at an elite rate, approaching 50%, though a huge chunk of that sample is from High-A. He'll show you the odd changeup now and again, and I think you can actually project on that pitch over the long haul because of Mejia's delivery and athleticism. I think he's going to be a late-inning reliever, and how good he becomes will be determined by whether or not Mejia can improve the quality of his fastball locations.","BW7sjXmHH9o","sa3003159"

He reached Double-A near the end of 2023 and is back there this year, and he continues to perform above the league average despite a slightly elevated strikeout rate. Beavers has a classic low-ball swing and he's geared to hit with loft, averaging 20 degrees of launch. The quickness of Beavers' hands will make you say, ""Dam!"" His most skillful attribute as a hitter is his ability to adjust the posture of the rest of his body to help guide his hands around the bottom two-thirds of the zone. Beavers' uphill swing path still ends up underneath a ton of high fastballs and he's likely to mature into a below-average hit tool. This is why we have him evaluated as a platoon bat, but he'll probably be an uncommonly versatile one. Beavers is passable in center field, quite good in the outfield corners, and he's begun to play first base (where he's crude). He's a post-2025 40-man add and part of the very crowded upper-level corner contingent that Baltimore can't feasibly keep completely together.","_edjYZqm0YU","sa3019983"

He spent a fair bit of his 2023 whole-season debut on the shelf with a non-displaced fracture of his left shoulder, which may have impacted his offensive output upon return. Brown hit .255/.358/.354 in 2023, mostly at High-A, and then had a stronger Fall League look (.297/.391/.462). 
Brown's unique swing has been toned down a bit since college but is still entertaining and strange, as his hands start up around his face (they used to be directly over top of his head) with his bat pointing toward the third base coach. He's such a compact, short-levered athlete that he's usually on time to make contact despite his swing's noise, and Brown performed about as well as hoped from a bat-to-ball standpoint in 2023, with a 90% z-contact rate. He's especially adept at making contact with high pitches and was executing a pull-and-lift approach in the AFL. Brown's T-Rex arms can make it tough for him to cover the down/away portion of the zone, and he's going to need to close his stride and bend in the lower body to get to those pitches. He struggles with this, and his tendency to play upright extends to his defense at shortstop, which is flashy but inconsistent. Brown simply isn't a very good bender — his range and creativity are fantastic, but there are certain plays he makes too slowly because of a lack of lower body flexibility. 
There will probably need to be adjustments in order for Brown to hit his ceiling, but his contact ability and aspects of his athleticism are pretty special. I think he'll be a Jon Berti type of utilityman even if some of his current issues remain, and if Brown solves them, he has a regular shortstop's skill set.","hYA_nIRHo0I","sa3019923"

He obliterated the Cal League and was promoted to High-A Everett about a week prior to list publication. 
Montes and the Mariners have done a great job not only keeping his frame in check, but reshaping it in a way that has made Montes more lithe and mobile in 2024. Last year, it looked like he had already maxed out and might quickly enter DH-only athletic territory. It's not as though Montes is suddenly a speedster (he's running about 4.7 from home to first and has below-average corner outfield range), but if he can play an actual position, it will take some pressure off his bat. The most curious thing about Montes' physical transformation is that it's coincided with a bit of a downtick in his measured power. Both his hard-hit rate (from 43% in 2023 to 33% so far in 2024) and the average of his hardest 10% of balls in play (106 mph to 104 mph) has dropped. Both his 2024 marks are a shade below the big league average — not the output of a guy who should actually be slugging .550 or anything like that. It's absolutely possible, maybe even likely, that Montes will recapture power as he ages and fills out again, this time with the guidance of Seattle's stateside strength program. 
How much is he going to hit? Montes' contact rates are up compared to 2023, but he's still beatable with fastballs around his belt. He has more in-zone swing-and-miss than the average big leaguer. Montes is an enormous guy but has pretty short levers, and it's atypical for someone built like he is to have such a big hole in his swing in that part of the zone. I want Montes to leave Seattle's lower level affiliates, where offensive production tends to be inflated because of the league (Modesto) or park (Everett), and mash at Arkansas before stuffing him in the Top 100 as a slugging everyday right fielder. I don't think there's terrifying hit tool bust risk here, but I do think it's likely that it matures south of major league average, and that Montes will need a righty-hitting caddy and to come off the field for defensive reasons at times.

Though his expected stats based on quality of contact are quite a bit beneath his surface-level performance, Abreu is still having a terrific rookie season and looks like a very solid corner platoon option who'll get most of the right field at-bats due to his handedness. I wrote last year that Abreu's incredible 2022 walk rates seemed inflated based on his underlying data and indeed he regressed in that regard in 2023, as his plate discipline was closer to average on the surface and under the hood. His swing is geared for extreme lift, something his relatively short levers enable since his barrel needs to take a longer path to get on such an uphill plane. This style of hitting leaves Abreu vulnerable to high fastballs, which he often swings underneath. The lack of a true plus tool offensive tool here is offset by Abreu's plus corner defense and huge arm.

A contact machine, he struck out just twice in 69 plate appearances during his COVID-shortened 2020 college season, but Martin struggled at shortstop and only had a few games in center field before the shutdown, not enough for teams to know whether he could actually play there.

He's spent the last couple of years in the upper reaches of the Twins system before debuting at the start of 2024.
Martin has sustained his plus contact ability against upper-minors arms, but he still hasn't solidified himself as an average defender at any one defensive spot. Instead, he's mostly playing a mix of CF/LF, neither of them particularly well. While many aspects of his profile are either middling or murky, Martin is going to hit.

Currently at Low-A St. Lucie, Baez's strikeout rates have trended in a better direction as he's climbed from rookie ball thanks to the combination of his good-but-not-great barrel feel and his short levers, which enable him to have a fairly noisy and aggressive swing without it actually being too long. He has all-fields power that is currently of the doubles variety. Baez isn't especially projectable, but his explosivity is exciting and he should have above-average raw power at peak. Whether he gets to all of it is going to be dictated by whether he can become more selective. Baez is incredibly chase prone, but he has been talented enough to perform on offense so far despite this.

He eventually signed with St. Louis, a club that tends to have late-market money for Cuban players or anyone else who becomes available later in the signing calendar. Cho has medium size, but he has a great frame and notable room for added strength. As a 19-year-old in the Florida State League in 2023, he slashed .270/.376/.389 and went 32-43 in stolen base attempts — and remember, the FSL tends to suppress slugging. 
Cho utilizes an all-fields approach and is producing a lot of hard contact to the opposite field at present. Although he hasn’t been able to do it consistently, he will show the ability to turn on a baseball and produce above-average raw juice to his pull side. It’s average bat speed and a path that stays in the zone for an extended period while having natural loft throughout the swing. Cho does have a tendency to go through stretches where he becomes overly top-hand dominant, which results in a lot of lazy grounders to the right side of the infield against softer secondary pitches. He has also continued to show he’s vulnerable to expanding the zone and chasing spin, especially against left-handed pitchers. 
Defensively, Cho saw time at all three outfield spots in 2023, but he's been roaming center field every day for Peoria so far this season. He’s an average runner, but his range in center plays at a fringe-average level due to his tendency not to take clean, efficient routes to balls in either gap. He plays with big effort, and his field awareness and decision-making with the baseball are advanced. There's a chance Cho is a corner platoon outfielder with a plus glove, like Red Sox rookie Wilyer Abreu has been.","lH5tIsW6fdw","sa3019526"

He enjoyed a velo spike as he was moved to the bullpen in pro ball and is currently presiding as the closer at Double-A Midland. Holman is a three-pitch reliever. He sits 93-95 and hurls his gigantic frame directly at the plate, enabling him to bully the zone with average velocity but plus extension. Both of his secondary pitches are capable of missing bats, and at times, his slider has very impressive two-plane movement for a pitch that bends in around 87 mph. Still, his changeup is his most consistent and dangerous offering. It has bat-missing sink, and Holman tends to command it to enticing locations. His ability to attack hitters of either handedness separates Holman from the generic middle relief group in the 40 FV tier. He has a shot to be a more important bullpen cog.","-pGI_sv1mmY","30002"

There is a gap between those who believe the lilliputian catcher is too small to withstand the beating of the position and those who think he has an exceptional toolset and rare athleticism for a backstop. Barriga is indeed remarkably twitchy for a squat 5-foot-6 or so (he's listed at 5-foot-9, but he ain't that), and he can really run for a catcher. His quickness is most evident on defense, where his mobility and explosion leaving his crouch are both impressive. Barriga was limited to just 10 regular season games on the complex last year because of a gruesome compound fracture to his femur, which he suffered while simply rounding first base. People in attendance at that game describe the injury as sounding like a broken bat. 
Barriga is back with a vengeance and looks great again this spring, but we simply don't know whether his little body will be able to withstand the grind of catching across a full season until he actually does it. The same applies to his offense, which will be subject to the wear and tear of catching. Barriga has performed well from a bat-to-ball standpoint in a small sample and looks hitterish to the eye, especially when it comes to snatching pitches at the top of the strike zone. He has all-fields doubles pop, which will be more than enough for him to profile as a catcher if he can retain a plus hit tool and on-base skills. Even without any kind of physical projection, the tools and skills of a primary catcher are here, it's just that Barriga would be defying convention in a meaningful way by attaining that role, as most big league backstops are hulksters. It's more likely Barriga becomes an Austin Barnes or Garrett Stubbs type of backup, but there are definitely scouts who like him more than that. He's perhaps the most fun prospect in this entire system.","WjcGmAIsFDw","sa3018595"

He punched out 50 hitters in his first 37 innings and worked efficiently enough to pitch into the fifth and sixth inning during several starts, a rarity for him at Miami. After his June 10 start, however, the Phillies began to drastically limit the length of McFarlane's outings, his stuff waned, and he was ultimately shut down at the end of August. A source close to the situation told me McFarlane had Tommy John during the offseason (I'm not sure of the exact date), which will put him out for all of 2024. 
Healthy 2025 McFarlane could enjoy a Kerkering-like rise through the minors, especially if the Phillies decide to 'pen him. When he was totally healthy early in 2023, McFarlane was sitting 98-100 mph, then he backed into the 94-97 range closer to when he was shut down. His monster arm strength helps make up for his fastball's tailing shape, created by McFarlane's nearly side-arm delivery. His gyro slider induced a plus-plus 21% swinging strike rate against A-ball hitters (an important caveat) in 2023, and McFarlane also has a rare changeup that he threw fewer than 50 times last season. 
There were good reasons for the Phillies to try to develop him as a starter. Miami doesn't seem to max out their pitchers on campus, and McFarlane's fastball featured better sink in pro ball. He also has a great pitcher's frame and is a fabulous on-mound athlete. But now that he's going to miss all of 2024 and enter his 40-man evaluation season (2025) with so few innings under his belt, it's much more likely McFarlane is moved quickly as a potential late-inning weapon, assuming his stuff comes back after his rehab.",,"sa3020633"

After some rocky starts early during his freshman year, something clicked for the right-hander and he was utterly dominant during the second half, culminating in a 19-strikeout no-hitter in a postseason game against Duke. That outing, and Vanderbilt's run to a national title, made Rocker a household name even among casual baseball fans. He made just three starts (and had some command issues) as a sophomore before COVID-19 ended the season. Then Rocker came out in 2021 in what looked like the best shape he'd ever been in and with a slightly higher release point. He was fantastic early on, but his stuff slipped as the spring progressed (Rocker's fastball averaged 95 mph in February, but 93 in June). His overall performance at Vanderbilt — 236.2 IP, 321 K, 68 BB, 2.89 ERA against mostly SEC competition — was incredible, especially when viewed in light of his stuff's inconsistent quality. 
Those fluctuations became inextricable from Rocker's pre-draft profile, though. It meant most teams thought he belonged behind similarly talented, but safer-feeling prospects in the 2021 draft rather than being clearly in the top tier, and Rocker fell a little further than expected on draft night, going 10th overall to the Mets. New York, whose rest-of-draft behavior indicated they had come to an overslot agreement with Rocker, was scared enough of his post-draft physical to squash his deal. He pitched in the independent Frontier League in 2022 and his velocity was mostly back, but again his arm slot had totally changed and was much lower than when he finished up at Vanderbilt. The Rangers surprised everyone when they made Rocker, who was ranked 60th on my draft board and evaluated as a quick-moving reliever, a top five pick in the next year's draft, albeit at an under-slot amount. 
Rocker pitched in the 2022 Arizona Fall League, where his slider looked incredible and his 95-97 mph fastball played down due to its tailing shape and his fringe command of it. He looked like he was projected: A quick-moving reliever who you want in the big leagues pronto, while he's healthy. Sadly, Rocker's elbow blew out in May of 2023 and he had Tommy John, shelving him until he made his first rehab appearance a few days before this update. Rocker touched 99 mph and worked two innings. It looks like the Rangers are going to keep developing him as a starter, and unless the big league club gets hot soon and is suddenly both contending and in desperate need of a good reliever, there's no reason to 'pen Rocker right now. He's still projected here as a contender's third bullpen banana due to his health track record and ""round down"" fastball playability. It's conceivable he could debut during the second half of 2024.","i9ljeJlzB5A","31843"

He has an absurd 91% contact rate so far in 2024 and has posted high-end rates of contact his entire career. Sanoja's special hand-eye coordination is most evident when he puts pitches in play that he has no business swinging at, up around his chest. He isn't very strong, but he is remarkably athletic and he can maintain a high-effort swing to produce sufficiently hard contact for the big leagues. Sanoja has been developed at both middle infield spots and in center field. He isn't an ideal fit at shortstop (his range is weirdly mediocre despite his speed because Sanoja is simply too small to reach for some balls hit near him), but he can play there in a pinch and he's capable at second base and in center.

He starts on the first base side of the rubber and strides open, creating an odd release point for a righty. The angle it creates on his fastball crowds the hands of opposing righties. Most guys with low release heights aren't as long-limbed as Pena, who also generates seven feet of extension. His cutter lacks the bat-missing length of a typical reliever's secondary pitch (which is why it isn't called a slider here), but it's really hard and he's thrown a few of them in the 94-97 mph range this year.

Parker also added a new slider in 2023 and his mid-80s splitter is arguably his most consistently located weapon. It's a starter's mix of pitches, and Parker's elaborate delivery (which generates nearly seven feet of extension) is deceptive, but it's also hard to repeat and he has been projected as a reliever here at FanGraphs for his lifetime as a prospect. The way Parker's fastball plays doesn't require him to have precise command, but his feel for location is south of what we feel comfortable projecting as a long-term starter, or as a starter on a contending team. Parker is still an impact arm of sorts, but more as a luxury swingman and long reliever like Nick Martinez or Josh Winckowski. Parker has been surprisingly efficient as a big league starter so far and had a dandy start just before list publication, but that sample is rather small compared to his historically walk-prone style and we anticipate he'll back into something closer to the double-digit walk rate he showed over the previous several seasons.

His velocity has slowly been ticking down since then, and he sat mostly 92-94 in 2023 as he made 21 regular season starts (interrupted by a hammy strain) and then did a mix of starting and relieving in yet another Fall League. 
His fastball still has in-zone bat-missing ability thanks to its other traits, but it isn't the dominant offering of late 2021. Flores still has two good-looking breaking balls — a spike curveball and a cutter — that looked better to my eye in Arizona than they played on paper during the regular season. His knuckle curve's shape plays nicely off his fastball, and Flores' cutter/slider has above-average length, but varies in shape. He threw changeups at an 8% clip during the summer, but I didn't see one in Arizona. He's now on the 40-man, but the Tigers don't need to rush a decision as to whether or not Flores is a starter or multi-inning reliever. He has all three option years left, and they have a fairly deep group of starters ahead of him after adding Jack Flaherty and Kenta Maeda in free agency. If you could guarantee me that Flores' fastball would sit in the mid-90s if he was allowed to air it out an inning or two at a time, I'd prefer that to the low-90s starter version of him. I'm projecting him in relief here, but again, the Tigers have the depth and flexibility to see how things go with Flores as a starter for another year.","HBewrbdcaII","sa3015223"

Over the two levels, he posted a .248/.357/.481 slash line across 255 plate appearances while striking out 24.3% of the time and walking 12.9% of the time. He's off to a hot start in 2024, with an OPS north of .800 and nine home runs, a 20-plus homer pace. 
Baez is very physical, wielding comfortably plus bat speed with minimal effort. He is wider and more broad-shouldered than he is tall, but there's still physical projection here, and Baez should be extremely strong at peak considering how good Houston's strength and conditioning program seems to be (at least based on how many of the hitters in their system look). He has a chance to grow into titanic power, which would make Baez an impact player even in a corner outfield spot so long as he hits enough, though we're starting to have some question marks on that score because his rate of chase is very high. He hits out of an open, slightly crouched stance, and uses a toe-tap trigger as his timing mechanism. Baez utilizes an all-fields approach and has above-average bat speed. His build and offensive forecast are in the Franmil Reyes mold, and it's going to be important for Baez to either stay mobile and lithe or refine his approach so that he has a more complete offensive skill set once he starts to regress as an athlete. He has heart-of-the-order talent, but we'd be cautious about making Baez the centerpiece of a deadline deal because righty corner bats with plate discipline this poor are risky propositions.",,"sa3018482"

The muscular 22-year-old has plus-plus power, but he’s only truly dangerous in the very middle of the zone. He ran a 64% contact rate in 2023, as Luciano lacks the barrel feel to impact pitches all over the zone. He often works to the opposite field, but this is more a product of his bat path than expert feel to hit. Chase has historically also been somewhat of an issue for Luciano, but scouts coming out of Sacramento this year have had positive things to say about the quality of his at-bats, just not his hit tool. 
If he could play shortstop, his contact issues might be liveable given how much power Luciano has, but his defense isn’t consistent enough to consider him a shortstop. He has the arm for it, but his range and hands are not as reliable. It's tough to find anyone who is comfortable projecting Luciano on the infield at all, let alone at its most difficult position. Aside from a handful of games at second base (most of those in LIDOM rather than with a Giants affiliate), he has only ever been developed at short. Now in his second option year, the time to assess Luciano at other positions is dwindling. If you believe his hit tool is insufficient to support a profile at any other position, it makes sense to try to force things at short for as long as possible. The positive outcome here is something similar to Miguel Sanó's Twins arc, where the power provides for a couple peak seasons, but near bottom-of-the-scale contact ability and frustrating defense have Luciano more often looking like a 40-grade player. Teams down the competitive continuum that may want to take a post-hype flier on Luciano sometime during the next year and a half should have a very firm idea of how they might help him improve on at least one side of the ball. We think Luciano will have a lefty-mashing window of relevance, but he isn't a foundational, impact player.","PC6wq1FXPGA","25616"

It will likely keep him out for all of 2024, is his second major injury in a relatively short span of time, and alters Frasso's FV more than a TJ because shoulders tend to be more disruptive and can have lasting negative impact. Compounding those worries are Frasso's mechanics, which are entertaining as hell to watch but not typical of a big league starter.

Murphy threw 89.2 innings, posted 113 strikeouts and 32 walks, and ended the season at High-A. 
Murphy throws quality strikes with his fastball, which has vertical ride, helping it punch above its weight. His two breaking balls — an 81-85 mph slider and a slower 12-to-6 curveball — have lovely natural shape and break (especially the curveball), but both would benefit from more velocity (especially the slider). Though he doesn't really have a changeup right now, Murphy's athleticism and feel to pitch should enable growth in this area. Murphy has a silky smooth and repeatable delivery, but it was tough to project on his velo while he was in high school because he had a boxy, relatively mature frame. He looked more lithe in 2023, and was physically more like a typical medium-framed college-aged pitching prospect. Murphy was off to a hot start in 2024 (though he was not throwing any harder) before he blew his UCL and needed TJ at the beginning of June. The timing of the surgery makes Murphy a 2025 Fall League candidate, as he'll most likely be back very late next year, if at all. The 2026 season is Murphy's 40-man platform year, and it will be interesting to see how Atlanta handles his innings count and promotion pace once he returns.",,"sa3020330"

He spent all of 2023 at High-A, where he improved in every column of his triple-slash line, while striking out just 10.7% of the time and nearly matching that in walks, this time over a full season. His 5.2% swinging strike rate was the among the very lowest in all of the minor leagues, further illustrating his knack for getting his bat on the ball, but his minute barrel rate adds clarifying detail. Kasevich’s contact skews heavily toward singles, mostly comprised of flare popups and well-placed soft line drives to the shallow part of the outfield, making him a hyper-realized contact-over-power prospect. Defensively, Kasevich has mostly spent time at shortstop (his college position), but his range and arm utility are iffy fits there, in particular grounders to his right. He’s better moving to his glove-side, which seems conducive to a possible move to third base, where he also notched a substantial number of innings in 2023 and is likely to see more time going forward as the Jays reckon with a potentially Matt Chapman-less future.

He had Tommy John in July, and a typical rehab timeline would hopefully put him in range to pitch in a competitive setting again late in 2024. Healthy Hughes sits 93-95 mph early in his outings, then tends to fall off into the low 90s late, with cut and sink that keeps him off barrels. I think it's fair to conclude his huge dip in velocity was a result of injury and not a decline in talent, and Hughes is lined up on the Rockies list under the assumption that his arm strength returns. He also has a two-plane slider that transitioned from being a short, cuttery pitch into a more traditional sweeper that more often has bat-missing length. A slower curveball that Hughes can land for a strike gives him a starter mix that, ideally, could use another weapon against lefties. Hughes' size, athleticism, arm speed, and stuff were all very exciting prior to the TJ (though his delivery was pretty violent), and I had him projected as a workhorse no. 4/5 starter on a good team.

His fastball sat 91 mph across 40 innings during the second half of 2023, but Young has enjoyed a two-tick leap this season. That has had a multiplicative effect on the pitch's quality thanks to Young's underlying fastball traits; he was utterly dominant at Double-A Bowie early in 2024 and quickly promoted to Norfolk. His stuff, including some of his fastball's movement, has backed up after the promotion, but Young still has a well-defined four-pitch mix and plus command, which should allow him to be a no. 4/5 starter if he can sustain this kind of arm strength. 
Of his secondaries, only his changeup is generating a plus rate of swing-and-miss, and Young locates his secondary pitches in the zone much more than is typical of a big league starter. His curveball has nearly elite spin, but Young actually deploys his mid-80s changeup a little more frequently than Uncle Charlie.

Perales was sitting 96-98 and touching 100 before the TJ, which is up two ticks from last season. Another reason Perales profiled in relief: His due north arm slot created downhill angle on his fastball that made it vulnerable to contact. Around the time he blew out, he was allowing a wOBA of nearly .400 on that pitch and generating an average CSW% for a fastball. He seemed to be taking a cutter-heavy approach this year, though some of what I think auto pitch-tagging was classifying as his cutter were actually splitters that cut on him. 
Make no mistake, this is a buck nasty pitching prospect with late-inning stuff. His cutter has slider shape when it's located down but it plays like a cutter when it's located up, and Perales' splitter has enough depth to play as a bat-misser against hitters of either handedness. This was Perales' first year on the 40-man roster and now he'll spend just about all of his second one on the IL rehabbing from TJ. The Red Sox will almost certainly be granted a fourth option year for him via an injury exemption, which gives them more time to stretch him back out as a starter if they want to, but if they're competitive like they are now upon his return, I'd just put him in the bullpen and have him let it eat as a setup man or closer.",,"sa3014677"

He has oppo gap power if you want to work away from him, and he'll snatch fastballs up around his hands if you dare try him in there. His walk rate so far in the 2024 FCL is more than triple his strikeout rate. Don't confuse that for patience — this is a swing-happy hitter, it's just that it's so hard to make Pena swing and miss that eventually FCL pitchers are walking him, though more because of their control limitations than Pena's plate skills. Pena has played a mix of second base, third base, and left field. Eric saw him play the latter two during his recent Florida jaunt and Pena approached balls too slowly as an infielder. If indeed he ends up an outfielder, Pena will need to hit so much that his game power outpaces his raw, as he's a smaller guy not likely to add a ton of strength as he matures.

By far the best secondary pitch in Woods' arsenal is his changeup, which he sells very well with his arm action; its late action generates above-average swing-and-miss. His 75-78 mph breaking ball is a tweener that often lacks sharpness and will likely need a tweak to its shape to become a usable third pitch.

He has only 15 extra-base hits (two home runs) in his 245 professional plate-appearances as of this writing, while striking out 28% of the time at Low-A Palm Beach. Davis’ pro swing is slightly more compact with a bit less loft in the path compared to the swing we saw from him in his last year at Arizona, and it's shocking this guy isn't hitting in the FSL, which should be beneath an experienced college hitter. 
Davis is in the middle of a position shift. He only played left field as a junior but has played a mix of center and left in pro ball. Team sources see him profiling in the corner outfield spots due to his fringe-average range in center. There isn't much Davis center field defense on tape because he's so new to the position. From the Cardinals' perspective, there’s incentive to develop Davis in center field for as long as possible to raise the overall floor of his profile, especially if the bat continues to sputter.

In 2023, at age 20, he was the youngest pitcher in baseball to reach Triple-A, but most of his season was spent at Double-A Birmingham, where he posted one of the lowest swinging strike rates in the minors. As is often the case with Latin American starting pitcher prospects, Mena was added to the 40-man while he still had developing to do, and he is currently rostered at a young age 21 and scrapping with older hitters at Triple-A. The Diamondbacks acquired him from the White Sox in exchange for Dominic Fletcher just before the season in what felt like an no-brainer trade for Arizona, an org loaded with tweener outfielders. 
Mena has good breaking stuff but his low-90s fastball lacks life and is very vulnerable. He's gone from having a curveball to both a curve and a slider, the latter of which is also effective due to Mena's consistent glove-side command. Both pitches share the 81-86 mph velocity band and are trending a little harder than that lately. You can project on Mena's changeup (which is currently firm, about 88 mph) because he's a terrific on-mound athlete with a super short, clean arm stroke. Because his fastball is light, we're probably looking at more of a backend starter profile here, with Mena's upside coming from the possibility that a change of scenery and physical maturation will help coax more arm strength out of him over time. It's pretty likely that he pitches in the big leagues at some point in 2024 and he could challenge Tommy Henry for the last starter spot next spring.","llrpZ44a_wU","27974"

Leiter continues to start at Triple-A Round Rock and has made a couple of spot starts in the big leagues this year, but his walk rates are still elevated and the visual assessment of his command remains poor. I think especially while Leiter has several option years remaining, he's likely to remain a starter. It's too important for contending teams like Texas to have optionable starter depth to get through a season. He has the rest of his option years to develop in the rotation, but as those run dry, it becomes more and more probable that Leiter will move to the bullpen. 
He is sitting 96 and touching 99 as a starter while generating seven feet of extension and plus vertical break. If you want to be optimistic about the future of Leiter's release consistency, you can look at the way MacKenzie Gore righted the ship after he had severe strike-throwing issues with the Padres; similar to Gore, the explosiveness of Leiter's fastball should give him some margin for error in the zone. He's been homer-prone as a pro, which is somewhat inherent in the way Leiter has to work with his fastball in order to miss bats — he yields a ton of fly balls. The heater alone should allow Leiter to be a very good reliever in the event that he does move to the bullpen, even if he doesn't experience a velo bump when he does. He has a five-pitch mix but only the fastball and slider are consistently good, and that's funneling his forecast toward the bullpen as well. I'd expect Leiter to pitch in a spot start or backend capacity for another year or so before he's shifted into the bullpen, where I think he'll be one of the club's best couple of relievers.

He slashed .284/.417/.513 across Double- and Triple-A in 2023 and raised his career minor league line ton excellent .279/.415/.465. For the last couple of years, Black (and my forecast for him) has been fumbling around for a defensive home. He has largely played second base during the last half decade and gave center field a try in 2022, but moved to third base in 2023 and even began to get some reps at first. He actually looked pretty good at third base aside from his throwing stroke, which sometimes looks odd and lacks accuracy. It's a big enough issue that I have him projected to first base and will speculate he'll eventually play the outfield corner, as well. Black's 2023 power output was likely a caricature of his true ability. His game is grounded in his contact and (more significantly) on-base skills. He lacks the power typical of a corner infielder and I also have some reservations about his ability to carry above-average contact rates to the big leagues. Black needs a ton of effort to swing hard and his head often flies all over the place. His swing also has a hole in it (up and away) that will be probed by big league fastballs until he proves he can close it. So no, I don't have Black evaluated as an everyday player. Because he's backed into a fair bit of defensive versatility, runs well, and has a plus-plus skill in his plate discipline, he'll still have roster utility as corner role player of modest impact.","_0WzwN2Qt4o","29949"

His sweet looking swing succeeds more because of its compact nature than Lile's barrel feel, and he remains likely to struggle with velo up and away from him as he climbs the minors.

He quickly had a velo spike under the tutelage of the Mariners dev group and was in the 94-97 mph range during the early part of 2024. As Evans has gotten stretched out at Arkansas (which was an aggressive first full season assignment for someone who'd never been good before), his velocity has slipped into the 92-95 mph range and he's become quite hittable. The Mariners downshifted him into the bullpen for a little while to see if he'd really pop in a relief role (which makes sense considering their big league injuries), but Evans didn't take to it and Seattle announced not long before list publication that they were moving him back into the rotation. The way Evans looks mechanically and the way his fastball plays (or doesn't, in this case) are characteristics I associate with a reliever, though his repertoire depth should allow for multi-inning work. 
Evan's best pitch is his nasty two-plane slider, which averages 2,800 rpm and has enough depth to play against lefties. He has distinct cutter and an inconsistent changeup that round out his mix.

He destroyed opposing Colorado high schoolers, but that isn't especially telling.

He is trending more like a bat-oriented second baseman. There's still pretty considerable power-hitting upside here, and there has been no change to Martin's predraft FV grade even though his pro career is struggling to get off the ground.","UN5prU16mJ8","sa3023545"

It took just over $1.25 million to keep him from heading to Vanderbilt, and after he struggled with whiffs in his post-draft summer, he lit Low-A on fire to start 2023 and was acquired from Houston as part of the Justin Verlander trade. Some of Clifford's TrackMan data from the early portion of last season was so absurd that he merited consideration as a possible Top 100 prospect. His high-end exit velos were near the top of the scale and his contact rates were suddenly above-average. The sample wasn't big enough to consider Clifford's leap in bat-to-ball ability legitimate, and indeed after he was promoted out of Low-A, his strikeout rates spiked and have lived in a scary area ever since. Last list cycle, I cautioned readers against weighing his exit velo data too heavily, but even I didn't foresee him striking out as much as he has so far in 2024, when his whiffs have far outpaced his balls in play. 
The visual evaluation of Clifford as a hitter is one of passivity and a bottom-hand dominant swing that tends to be underneath fastballs in the upper half of the zone. Clifford shows the ability to move the barrel around the bottom two-thirds of the zone, and he cuts his stride with two strikes. He's a good rotational athlete whose move forward is balanced but explosive. But Clifford is hitting just shy of .160 against fastballs as of list publication, and unless he makes some kind of adjustment he's only ever going to be able to hit low-ball mistakes. Written up as a Lucas Duda type of platoon bat during his last scouting update, Clifford is not only trending down, he's on increasingly thin ice, especially without a good defensive component to his profile.",,"sa3020126"

Over his 78 innings of work in 2023, he struck out 26.3% of batters and walked 9.1% on his way to posting a 5.42 ERA in the Cal League as a 22-year-old. 
Hurtado throws both a four- and two-seam fastball that average 95 mph and touch 98 mph. The four-seamer tends to play down from that velocity because it lacks plus life, but the two-seamer will show significant late running action. Hurtado has a sharp mid-80s slider that features both horizontal and vertical break, but his feel for the offering is very hit-and-miss at present. There’s also a rarely utilized changeup in the arsenal, which at its best is thrown with quality arm speed and will feature fade and varying degrees of depth. While Hurtado continues to be developed as a starter, his inconsistent strike-throwing ability makes him best suited for a relief role, one that would hopefully allow him to tap into a few more ticks of velocity and unlock additional life on his four-seamer.",,"sa3019774"

Poised to be an optionable middle reliever in 2024, Mercado's relatively new cutter really tied the rest of his repertoire (mostly fastball/curveball) together when he added it in 2022. His velocity has yo-yo'd throughout his pro career and did so again in 2023 with a move to the bullpen, ticking up to the 94-96 mph range, which he'd only occasionally shown as a starter. Mercado is capable of missing a bat when he executes any of his three main pitches, but his stuff isn't so nasty that he can carve when he's imprecise.

Initially developed as a middle infielder, the Cubs have also tried Triantos for long stretches at third base (where he spent most of 2022) and center field (where he's only played a handful of games). As of list publication, Triantos is exclusively playing second base so far in 2024. He has not looked very good at any position, and he might be best suited to play a corner outfield spot (which he hasn't tried yet) than be an infielder at all. He's a worse hands-and-feet athlete and thrower than is typically found on the infield. Triantos had surgery for a torn meniscus and missed the first part of 2023, and it's possible he'll improve on defense as he gets further away from the surgery, but he looks like a 30-grade infield defender right now. The Cubs still have at least all of 2024 and 2025 to find a comfortable defensive fit for him, because Triantos doesn't have to be put on the 40-man until after the 2025 season.
It isn't as if being a bad-but-versatile defender (a poor second base & average left field mix seems feasible) is going to prevent Triantos from having a meaningful big league role, because he rakes. He posted an 82.4% overall contact rate and 92% z-contact rate in 2023, and he has a 9% swinging strike rate since entering pro ball. Medium raw power and a proactive approach tend to limit Triantos' slugging and stops one short of forecasting him as a star player, but he's going to hit enough to be a complementary regular who probably comes off the field for defensive purposes late in games.","RYoayN5iVcE","sa3017295"

Wrobleski more or less held that velo spike throughout 2023 and actually ended the year with several starts of velo increase, at times averaging 95 mph. 
Wrobo essentially has five pitches because of his ability to alter the shape and velocity of his fastball, and he's funneled his breaking ball usage away from his curveball and toward a slider/cutter combo that he commands very well. Can he sustain this more recent velo spike like he did the first one? The arrow has been pointing up slowly but steadily since Wrobleski returned from surgery.

De Los Santos' operation in the box is very loose, and his bat stays in the zone for an extended period while also creating significant loft to go along with above-average bat speed. He's struck out 24% of the time in his nearly 600 career plate appearances, but that’s more due to his tendency to expand the zone than a lack of feel for contact. On the dirt, his hands work well, and although he’s only an average lateral mover, scouts who have seen him at the complex this year like his instincts. The overall defensive chops will carry the glove enough that it projects to handle shortstop at an average level even once the frame is done filling out. De Los Santos gives good reason to dream big, and the confidence that he can continue to play shortstop raises his floor, but his overall ceiling hinges upon how much his approach will cut into his ability to produce contact as he faces more competent pitchers.

He missed all of June with an elbow injury, then returned for three starts in July, after which he was shut down for the remainder of the year with biceps soreness. Two distinct injuries to his pitching arm within such a short span of time is troubling, of course, though they help explain why his velocity was down compared to his high school look (he was in the 92-93 range in 2023). Barriera's body also changed, and during the little bit he pitched for Dunedin, he looked much heavier than he did in high school. Some of the added weight is clearly muscle, but the rate at which his conditioning has regressed is somewhat concerning. He'll barely be 20 when the 2024 season begins and has gone from looking like a Ricky Tiedemann clone in many ways to being built more like Graham Ashcraft. Because he’s still a teenager, the time and ability to trim down and/or build up his body’s fortitude to avoid injury is clearly here, but it's something to watch. 
When he was able to take the mound, he was a bit on the wild side, with an inordinate number of walks and HBPs, but that came with a 31.5% strikeout rate and a ridiculous 76.3% groundball rate, which was the highest in the minors for any pitcher with at least 20 innings. Granted, it’s doubtful he’d stay on the top of that column had he accrued more innings of work, but it’s still promising for the young southpaw. Barriera is still stylistically similar to Tiedemann: A low-slinging lefty with a lot of heat on his heater when he's healthy, a lot of sweep on his sweeper, and a promising changeup, though his high school command was not great. We're slightly discouraged by his 2023 for a number of reasons, but the ceiling here is still among the most exciting in this system. A source close to this situation told us Barriera's weight is down and that it will be an area of continued focus for him during the offseason. We're hopeful that he'll bounce back and we've mostly left his pre-draft valuation intact, but we're warning readers that we'll let air out of the balloon pretty quickly if Barriera displays some of these issues again in 2024.","RSQ5j-PDi1k","sa3020683"

He had a good freshman season for a first-year hitter in the SEC, then went to the Cape and raked, which he continued to do during his COVID-shortened sophomore year. His first draft-eligible season, 2021, featured an exorbitant number of strikeouts, but also lots of home runs: Fabian had the second-most strikeouts in Division-I baseball and was eighth in homers. Even though teams no doubt looked at the strikeout issues in the context of Fabian's age (he was 20 at the time), there was a gap between what teams were willing to do to sign him and what he wanted, so even though Boston drafted him in the second round, Fabian didn't sign and went back to Florida for a fourth season. He did quell his strikeout issues somewhat, with his K% dropping from 29% to 22% in 2022, and he went 67th overall and signed for $1 million. 
Fabian hit 24 homers in his first full pro season and spent the second half of it at Double-A. He struck out 37.5% of the time there and hit just .176 but still managed 15 bombs in 64 games. That is the sort of hitter Fabian is destined to be. He struggles to get to velocity up around his hands, and swings and misses a ton in the zone, more than all but a couple contemporary center fielders. But the explosion in Fabian's hands and the lift in his swing help ensure that he gets to his power when he's making contact, and he's quite a good outfield defender, so he's ticketed to play a part-time role in the Chas McCormick mold, another bats right/throws left fellow with contact rates near the bottom of the big league center field group.",,"sa3019942"

He finally got his first taste of pro baseball in 2021, and a season defined by gaudy stolen base totals ended with him being traded to Boston in the Hunter Renfroe deal. He's stolen 129 bases combined in his first two years in the Red Sox org and debuted in 2023. He's been up for most all of 2024 and is having a good rookie season, graduating with a 104 wRC+, which is a little north of what I'd expect him to produce throughout his big league career. 
Hamilton is a 70-grade runner who regularly gets down the line in the 4.00–4.10 second range. Minor league camera operators had trouble keeping him in frame, and his speed forces opposing infielders to rush their throws, often impacting their accuracy. This speed, combined with Hamilton's suitable shortstop defense, makes him very likely to play a part-time big league role for a long time. He made above-average rates of contact in the minors but did so as an old-for-the-level player. It thus felt prudent to round down on his hit tool projection a little bit, but Hamilton has had a relatively seamless big league transition aside from elevated chase. Vulnerable on the outer edge, Hamilton is best at turning on inside pitches, which is really the only part of the zone in which he's able to hit for power. More ""fine"" than excellent at short, Hamilton also got some run in center field during the 2023 season, but Boston's needs at the big league level have prevented that experiment from continuing so far in 2024.

Long and lean, his mobility and athleticism at his size are remarkable, and his range of potential outcomes is as gigatic as he is. 
Every aspect of Charles’ offensive profile is still extremely raw, including a chase-heavy approach, but he shows big bat speed and his swing is compact enough to balance out his long-levered build. Charles has struck out over 25% of the time in his brief professional career, but that looks like it has more to do with his well below-average swing decisions than anything else, because he’s whiffing less than 20% of the time on pitches in the zone. Charles has added a bit more pronounced of a hand load to his operation, but it’s still minimal and might indicate there's some untapped power potential here. It's kind of nutty how often Charles is able to pull the ball for a hitter his size, but he still often looks like a newborn giraffe when he swings, so while there's a chance things click for him in a huge way one day, that day has not yet arrived. 
Charles’ chops on the defensive end are much more advanced as he continues to split time between shortstop and third base. He has smooth, fluid actions at both positions, with an impressive amount of body control, especially given the size of his frame, and he has more than enough arm strength to complete the deepest of throws. With Charles’ body having so much maturing still to do, some believe he'll move off shortstop permanently and be a plus defender at the hot corner. But with the bat as raw as it is, his most likely path to the big leagues requires as much versatility as possible, and even as his frame adds bulk, he should be able to handle the position. Charles' defensive ability gives him a floor of sorts (think David Hensley), while his offense is a wild card with outcomes that include impact power.",,"sa3020497"

Because of his heavy college workload, Mathews didn’t pitch for a St. Louis affiliate after the draft. He has come out of the gates this season looking as sharp as any pitcher in the lower levels of the minors, and as of list publication, he is among the minor league strikeout and strikeout rate leaders. Mathews has seen a velocity bump on his fastball so far this season. He sat in the low 90s as a senior but has been sitting 92-96 mph and touching 97 mph through his first six starts of 2024, and the offering has consistently showed above-average carry through the zone, which has been effective at generating whiffs. He reliably throws his fastball for strikes, but it’s a control-over-command approach at present, perhaps evidence that Matthews is throwing with greater effort than in college. Mathews’ changeup is a legit bat-missing offering. It plays very well off his fastball, and his solid arm speed sells the pitch before creating late bottom action on it, which causes it to frequently disappear under bats. He also has two breaking balls; the slider is the sharper of the two, while the curveball projects to be more of a get-me-over strike stealer.

Lin's command and his fastball's underlying traits should allow it to be a viable pitch even though it has what nowadays constitutes 20-grade big league fastball velocity. Pitch models like the movement on Lin's breaking stuff, but he doesn't get great results with them, even against left-handed hitters. It's fair to project a little on Lin's velocity because he's a skinny 20-year old and a graceful athlete; if it ticks up, he could move into the Top 100. His current look is more like an efficient no. 4/5 starter on a good team and he's tracking for a late 2025 debut. Lin was struck by a line drive in the dugout a few days ago and fractured his jaw in several places, which will knock him out until the latter portion of the season.",,"sa3019278"

He came to the U.S. for baseball activity this year and has continued to slug in a profound way on the complex in Surprise en route to the ACL home run lead. 
If you catch Cabrera on the right day, he looks like a mini Juan Soto. His swing specifically is a dead ringer for Soto's in that it is ferocious and also geared for lift in the extreme. Cabrera has rare ability to uppercut the baseball basically all over the zone. He's even on an uphill path through the very top of the strike zone, à la Soto and Anthony Volpe. You can see this watching Cabrera swing a handful of times, but when you dig into the data, it's even more extreme. Cabrera has an average launch angle of 27 degrees. Only Daulton Varsho (also 27 degrees) is even in that neighborhood among current big leaguers. This isn't necessarily a good thing — part of the reason there's only one big leaguer with similar launch is because it isn't a sustainable way to approach big league pitching unless you're pretty special. Cabrera's bat speed and rotational verve is such that I think he'll be able to get to most of his considerable raw power in games but, like Varsho, it's going to come at the expense of his batting average in a severe way. Cabrera's breaking ball recognition also isn't awesome, which adds to the strikeout component of his profile. 
Scouts sitting on Texas in the ACL haven't all gushed about Cabrera. Plenty see him as a fringe fit in center field and then get scared of his contact profile once they project him to an outfield corner. How Cabrera's plate discipline evolves is going to be key for his profile. His swing works in such a way that he basically can't make contact with pitches that aren't in the strike zone (he has a 50% O-Contact% as of publication, 65% overall), and he'll ideally develop something more than the average plate discipline he has right now. This is a player who's really fun to scout in person and on the spreadsheet, and one of the more fascinating young hitters in the minors. I like what's happening here enough to have the equivalent of a mid-first round draft grade on Cabrera. He's freaky in mostly good ways and has legit plus bat speed. He's probably going to be a flawed big league hitter but will do enough damage to be a good one anyway.",,"sa3018549"

Lara is built like a college quarterback at a strapping, high-waisted 6-foot-3. He is a powerful, tightly-wound athlete whose feel for release is way, way behind his pure arm speed. Often, Lara's delivery isn't well-connected and he throws a ton of non-competitive fastballs. He also throws 100. Like the prospect version of Soriano or Arizona's Justin Martinez, Lara gets punished for this because his downhill heater is more vulnerable to contact than you'd expect given how hard he throws, and that's exacerbated by his lack of command. But again, Lara throws 100 and he also has a dastardly two-plane slider in the 89-92 mph range. It has cutter shape in a vacuum, but from Lara's high three-quarters slot, it effectively has the depth of a slider. 
Lara's build, arm strength, and slider quality are indicative of a late-inning relief prospect. It's conceivable he could improve his feel for release as he matures into his mid-20s. He's essentially a two-pitch guy right now. If he wants to go full Soriano, Lara will develop something like Soriano's splinker and/or refine the way his fastball dives to his arm side.

He especially crushed the Northwest League, where he hit 20 homers in just 76 games before a promotion to Double-A Hartford. He was promoted fairly aggressively to Triple-A Albuquerque (after just 50 Double-A games) at the start of 2024 and is off to a slugger's beginning there, too. 
Beck should get to enough of his power to be a useful big league role player, and he'll probably have a peak year or two where he plays more or less every day and hits 30 bombs, maybe more with help from Denver. But same as I wrote last year when he was crushing it at Spokane, I am apprehensive about projecting him to do it consistently and for an extended period of time because of the nature of his swing-and-miss. Beck had more swinging strikes than balls in play last year in a sample that was generated mostly at High-A. His 64% contact rate would rank near the very bottom of the big league outfielder population alongside players whose production is a pretty good comp for what I expect from peak Beck, like Brent Rooker and Luke Raley. Beck is a powerful, tightly wound athlete with thunderous raw power and above-average speed. His swing takes a long time to enter the hitting zone, often leaving him late on fastballs either at the belt or on the outer third of the plate. He has the pop to do opposite field damage when he actually makes contact with pitches away from him, but he whiffs out there a ton already even though he isn't yet seeing big league-level velo consistently. 
Beck is playing a mix of all three outfield positions but is destined for a corner in the majors. His speed gives him plus corner outfield range, while his ball skills and hands are below average. Rooker is the cleanest current big league comp for Beck from a production and profile standpoint, as the others are either toolsier (Jose Siri, Tyler O'Neill) or hit left-handed (Raley, Matt Wallner). There are scouts who have average everyday grades on Beck, and while I think he'll peak as such, I'll take the under across his years of team control because of the way it looks like his hit tool will trend.",,"31431"

He's a tightly wound athlete with some effort to his swing, and it's likely he'll whiff underneath high fastballs as he faces better velocity.

In his 568 plate appearances between the two levels, he kept his strikeouts at an acceptable 20% while walking at a 9.5% clip. Wallace’s offense started off on a better note in 2024, as he slashed .282/.350/.427 in 140 PA before being sidelined for over a month with an oblique injury. He is just now getting ready to return to Northwest Arkansas after a brief rehab stint at the complex. 
Wallace has a repeatable operation in the box, with a balanced stance and a minimal toe-tap timing trigger. The top hand takes charge in his hacks and produces a bat path that is on the flatter side of the spectrum, more capable of producing gap-to-gap line drives than light-tower juice. At the hot corner, his hands show softness when fielding grounders to both sides of his body, and he handles soft contact in front of him especially well. His above-average arm strength enables him to complete any play required of a third baseman, and he controls his body well when ranging for balls on the run. 
Wallace's offensive profile is a bit light for an everyday third baseman, but he's a well-rounded second division regular type who would likely hold down a weak-side corner platoon role on a contender's roster. He's yet to get experience at another position since breaking into the pro ranks. Maikel Garcia probably hasn't yet hit his ceiling and could be entrenched at the hot corner for a while, so Wallace branching out will likely be vital to maximizing his skill set in a way that helps both the Royals and Wallace's overall future.",,"sa3019996"

Joseph swings hard for his age but with imprecision. Initially seen as one of the fastest players in the class, he has already begun to fill out to the point where that's no longer true. Joseph is playing shortstop in the DSL, though there were scouts on the amateur side who thought he might be a better fit in center field.

Two years of struggles with the Commodores resulted in just 39 total at-bats before Malloy transferred to Georgia Tech for his junior year. He slashed .308/.436/.558 with more walks than strikeouts as a Yellowjacket in 2021, his only collegiate season with actual playing time. Without a clear defensive position, Malloy fell all the way to Atlanta's sixth round pick. Within a year and a half, Malloy had coasted through Double-A and a great Arizona Fall League stint with a career OBP north of .400. The Braves traded him to Detroit for Joe Jiménez during the 2022-23 offseason, and Malloy produced another huge, OBP-driven .277/.417/.474 line in 2023 with Toledo. 
While not yet on the 40-man roster, Malloy is in position to compete for big league playing time in 2024 as Detroit's third base situation evolves. Like most of the Tigers' other upper-level position player prospects, he is not a particularly good defensive infielder. After he only played the infield in college, the Braves and Tigers have given Malloy about 50 starts in the outfield corners each of the past two seasons, and while he doesn't look especially comfortable there, his air-it-out arm strength is plus. 
Malloy's thunderous hands create big power in a short distance, and he's capable of torching pull-side contact, but I don't believe he has quite enough hit tool to be a regular corner outfielder or third baseman. Big league pitchers will bully JHM in the parts of the strike zone that he struggles to cover, and in addition to the whiffs, I worry his plate skills won't shine quite like they have so far because big leaguers know they can get him out in the strike zone. His best shot at securing a meaningful big league role includes defensive versatility that isn't yet present in his skill set. 
There is still some ironing out do to on defense, but the Tigers have the luxury of another year to do it before Malloy has to be put on the 40-man, and the field of similar players ahead of him is pretty dense, which makes me think it's more likely that Malloy will debut in 2025 than in 2024.

Doncon had a mediocre 2023 with the bat — .215/.283/.368, albeit with a career-high 14 homers — but he looked much better on defense. 
He currently has the actions and arm strength for shortstop, but he's still young and has a lot of room on his frame, which means he may yet outgrow that position and move to either second or third base. Doncon's pitch recognition isn't great, and he's a bit more chase and whiff prone than is ideal, but he has good power for a hitter his age and is probably going to grow into more. The longer he can stay at short, the better chance he gives himself of being a useful big leaguer despite his flaws. The Twins have two seasons to develop Doncon before they have to decide whether to expose him to the Rule 5 draft, and realistically they have another year or two beyond that to let him barbecue on the 40-man if they really want to. He brings an element of upside to their system as well as an element of risk.

It’s a lean, medium frame that can still handle additional mass in coming years; that, along with his eventual transition to a relief role, will give him an extra grade of fastball velocity in short-burst duties. Ullola’s fastball, which sits 92-96 mph and already touches 98 mph, has plus carry through the zone.

The last offering in Ullola’s mix is a changeup; it's a low-impact pitch that often lacks effective action and plays down even more due to his inability to land it in the zone (21% in-zone rate in 2024). We don't think the strike-throwing component here will ever be good enough for Ullola to start, but we also think he'd enjoy a velo spike out of the bullpen and have a dominant big league fastball as a result, which would spearhead some late-inning work.",,"sa3016504"

He's had stretches of wildness where he's walked nearly a batter per inning, but Rodríguez is incredibly athletic, the sort of on-mound athlete for whom we think things will click over time, enabling him to be a core middle relief piece. Rodríguez's pitch mix is headlined by a fastball that regularly resides in the upper-90s and also features plus carry through the zone, which allows the offering to play despite his shotgun command. When his slider is at its best, it has a vertical, downer shape, and regularly has plus teeth. However, he has a tendency to get on the side of it, which gives the offering inconsistent shape and spin. Rodríguez has the pure stuff of a high-leverage reliever, but his lack of control and inconsistency in harnessing his mix looks to have him bound for a lesser role.

A scout source who caught McLean the week before publication thought he had a shot to develop three plus pitches. His secondary stuff is wildly inconsistent on tape, but it flashes plus, especially the slider. Don't worry about McLean being a little older than most developmental prospects. Because he was just drafted, he has as much time as any other college prospect to improve under the Mets org umbrella and is on a post-2026 season 40-man timeline.

The headliner offering here is the changeup, which Texido sells with fastball arm speed. It features 8-10 mph of velocity separation from his heater and has substantial late depth that allows it to regularly slip under barrels. Texido also has a slider (75-80 mph) that has traditional two-plane shape, but with an extra element of length to it that is created by his drastic crossfire direction. The secondary offerings carry the profile at present, but there's outlier deception here that has the potential to enable a fastball that otherwise wouldn’t be effective.

He was traded to the Cubs for David Robertson in the middle of a breakout 2022 season during which Brown struck out 13/9 IP across 100 innings of work. He started the 2023 campaign with a hot streak at Double-A, where he posted a 39% strikeout rate and a 0.45 ERA over four starts. That earned him a promotion to Triple-A, where he spent the remainder of the season. He was able to maintain an impressive strikeout rate at the higher level, but it came with an uncomfortable spike in his walk rate, which more than doubled — his BB/9 jumped from 2.70 to 6.32 — and Brown failed to work 100 innings due to his own inefficiency; he was shifted to the bullpen at the end of 2023. He was sent to Iowa when camp broke in 2024 to work as a starter, and it wasn't long before he was needed in the big leagues.
Brown's lack of fastball command impacts his performance in a few different ways, because he throws a lot of them nowhere near the zone and locates too many of them at the bottom of the zone, where the pitch is more vulnerable to contact. We've tended to think Brown will eventually be a reliever, albeit a damn good one. His fastball and breaking ball (he has scrapped his slider during the spring of 2024 to work with just one breaker) both generated plus chase and miss rates in 2023, and give him two impact pitches. He'll either need to develop a better changeup or a second distinct breaking ball to have what we'd consider a starter's pitch mix, and on top of that he needs to improve his command as he approaches age 25. It feels like a tall order. For now, it looks like Brown is going to shuttle back and forth between the rotation and bullpen as needed.

It's possible that like a lot of the hitters in this system, Alcantara is making an effort to swing as hard as he can and that he has to wind his whole body up with these elaborate gesticulations in order to do so, but he's often late to the contact point. If Alcantara is going to shorten up, then he has to get stronger. 
Still, there's no change to his FV grade here because Alcantara is such a slick defensive infielder that he stands a very good chance to be a high-end utilityman even if he has long-term issues with the bat. He is rangy and smooth, very agile and acrobatic, and he makes beautiful plays at both middle infield spots. Alcantara is only 19 and I think he still has a chance to layer meaningful strength onto his frame, though there are scouts who think his build is so slight that he won't. If the Red Sox decide to be deadline buyers, I'd kick the tires on Alcantara in trade talks if only to try to get a sense of the way they value him. This is still a prospect I'm on despite his current struggles because he's the best defensive shortstop (and maybe non-Rafaela player) in the org.",,"sa3018558"

His fledgling left-handed swing is long and sometimes out of control, but Ricardo swings with exciting verve and natural loft. There is no consensus about whether he will be able to stay at shortstop — international scouts and execs had mixed shortstop and third base projections here.

In the early goings of the 2024 season, Lin has shown an electric four-seam fastball that ranges between 94-99 mph and touched triple digits, and has obvious carrying action that is capable of missing bats in the zone. He also mixes in a 91-95 mph sinker that has more horizontal action. His slider doesn't have a huge spin rate, regularly registering under 2,000 rpm, but when he breaks off a good one, it has bat-missing depth and certainly isn't light on teeth. His changeup also varies greatly in quality from pitch-to-pitch. It will show substantial fade at its best and is an offering he’s shown he’ll use against both left-handed and right-handed hitters. Lin's delivery makes hitters uncomfortable (some of that is because his command is somewhat erratic) and will probably evolve as he grows into his body.

He missed the bulk of 2023 recovering from surgery but returned in time to toss 42 frames and strike out just under 30% of the hitters he faced. He has been dominant so far in 2024, posting a 29% strikeout rate and career-best 5% walk rate at Double-A Montgomery. 
Suddenly Seymour is not only back, but perhaps better than ever before, as he's made 15 dominant starts and thrown more innings than he has since the 95.2 frames he tossed in 2019 between Virginia Tech and a stint on Cape Cod. Violent deception and a plus changeup drive Seymour's ability to miss bats. He has an NC-17 delivery with a grotesque head whack, but it doesn't seem to inhibit his ability to throw strikes. His fastball sits an underwhelming 88-92 mph, but it holds its plane very well and, combined with the deception in his delivery, is playing like a plus pitch. His changeup has 10 ticks of separation from his fastball and he sells it like a seasoned used car salesman by maintaining his delivery's effort and arm speed. Seymour has two breaking balls, with his 80-84 mph slider the superior offering. It has two-plane shape and often shows considerable depth, and it's a really tough pitch for left-handed hitters to do much with. His curveball is a big, slow (69-74 mph) vertical breaker that is more of a strike-stealer than a pitch he’ll regularly rely on. He'll also mix in a short, mid-upper 80’s cutter that he uses as an additional weapon to stay off right-handers' barrels. 
Seymour is 25 years old now, so his dominance over Double-A hitters is to be expected, but given how fresh he is off TJ, the way he's sustained it start after quality start is very encouraging. We're still skeptical this kind of delivery can hold up under 120 innings or so, but Seymour is officially on his way to proving us wrong.

Now that he's back with Arizona, there's potentially a looming path to playing time, as star first baseman Christian Walker is in his contract year. 
De Los Santos has had plus-plus big league raw power since he was 19, but the rest of his game has been sushi raw. For basically his entire time as a prospect, including right now, De Los Santos' future has hinged on whether or not he'll get to enough power to support a lower-OBP first base profile. His selectivity at the plate and infield defense have ranged from “immature” to “god awful,” and the former was a big part of why he had a below-average all-around offensive season at Amarillo last year despite hitting 20 bombs. 
De Los Santos is kind of a freak, comparing physically to former NFL running back Michael Turner more than he does anyone else in baseball. He does not get cheated and swings as hard as he can at every opportunity. His slider recognition is awful; he chased them at a 49% clip in 2023, per Synergy. Christian Encarnacion-Strand has been a free-swinging canary in the coalmine for this kind of profile and things haven't gone especially well for him; a deeper look back at hitters of this ilk produces comps like Ryon Healy and C.J. Cron. De Los Santos is way more fun to watch swing and hit oppo bombs than that, but realistically, he's on a similar path.

Curry has taken a half step back at Hickory this season and is running an ERA over 7.00 as of list publication. This is despite Curry's fastball velocity climbing again. It's up a tick from last year, sitting 93-95. Curry mixes four- and two-seamers, and those plus his slider make up the lion's share of his pitch usage right now. Neither of his fastballs is performing especially well; they look pretty average and lack substantial difference in their movement. Curry's 81-84 mph slider is still his bread-and-butter and projects to a plus pitch at maturity. He also has a slower curveball and firm changeup, but their usage has been scant. My notes last year had Curry's changeup cutting on him often. That isn't happening so much any more and I still like the long-term projection of his change because of how loose and whippy his arm is. 
I'd really like to see Curry take a step forward from a strength and conditioning standpoint. He's lanky and tall, but his frame isn't well-composed; he looks like he could be so much stronger and more athletic than he is right now. Given that Curry's looseness is a big part of his talent, I wouldn't want him to overdo it and tighten up. But most big league pitchers have an element of strength to them that Curry does not right now.

Cantillo has four big league-quality pitches and below-average control. His fastball's movement and angle mean that he doesn't need surgical command for his heater to play, but he does need to improve his strike-throwing by another grade to work with a big league starter's level of efficiency. Any projection in this regard comes from Cantillo's relative lack of experience due to all that time off. His changeup is so good that even though he doesn't locate it consistently, it has still played like an impact pitch so far because of pure stuff. He also has two distinct breaking pitches, one of which (the slider) Cantillo locates better than all of his other offerings. With two option years left, there's still time for Cantillo to polish his control enough to project as a starter.

Alas, after dipping into the 91-95 mph range for most of his senior spring, Baumann remains in that velocity band in 2024. 
Baumann has been deploying a fastball-heavy approach at Low-A Augusta so far, mixing four- and two-seamers in pretty evenly. He is a much more advanced strike-thrower than most pitchers his age, let alone ones his size. Baumann's feel for locating his secondary pitches is way ahead of their pure nastiness. It may be tough for him to develop an impact breaking ball from a stuff standpoint, though it's possible Baumann's changeup will keep getting better and better the more he pitches.

During looks from minor league spring training and early on in extended spring as I prepped this list, I left with more skepticism around Calaz's hit tool than I anticipated, but the power is certainly real. 
Calaz's swing is akin to guys like Connor Joe and Elehuris Montero, and you can see the DNA of this swing throughout the Rockies org, as well as Pittsburgh and Toronto. Calaz's open-striding cut is geared to vaporize pitches middle-in and down, while he tends to inside-out pitches in other parts of the zone. He is extremely vulnerable to high fastballs, and because of his stride direction, he might be vulnerable to better sliders once he sees them. He ran a 71% contact rate in the DSL last year, which is pretty low for a prospect at that level. 
But holy cow, Calaz has power. He nearly hit my car in the D-backs backfield parking lot with a homer the Saturday before list publication, and he still has room on his frame for lots of mass and even more juice. He has a rare blend of strength and athletic fluidity; most hitters with this kind of power at this age are stiffer and wound pretty tight. Even before he signed there was industry sentiment that Calaz may ultimately be a DH, in part because of his lack of feel for the outfield, and after watching him all week, I think that's fair. He should be developed in right field to see if he can improve (there's no reason to DH him now), but he isn't an especially instinctive defender. Like Jordan Beck, Calaz has a middle-of-the-order ceiling and hit tool risk that threatens its consistency and attainability.

In 2023, he threw 87.1 innings at Fayetteville where, as the youngest and hardest-throwing member of the roster, he struck out 28.8% of batters he faced but also walked 17.9%. After starting the 2024 season on the IL, Santa is back and throwing even harder than he was last year, sitting 95-98 mph (he averaged 95 in 2023) and peaking at 100. His fastball has above-average riding life through the zone at a downhill angle, and it powers past A-ball hitters. Presently, Santa really lacks feel for both of his breaking balls. The curveball is a deep 12-to-6er that regularly flashes plus teeth, while the slider has two-plane shape with late tilt when it's at its best. Especially with the slider, Santa tends to get on the side of the ball, which results in less efficient break. While Santa is still being developed as a starter, it’s apparent his shotgun command is better suited for the bullpen, where he projects as a power middle-reliever with the ceiling of a late-inning bullpen piece.",,"sa3015478"

Even though he's always gotten a pretty good helping of groundballs, Spence gave up a whopping 30 homers in 2023, at a ridiculous 20.5% HR/FB rate. That hasn't been an issue so far in 2024. In addition to his naturally cutting heater, Spence has two rock solid breaking balls that generate the lion’s share of his swing-and-miss. His low-80s curveball has nearly perfect 12-to-6 shape, while his mid-80s slider (perhaps explicitly a sweeper) has traditional two-plane break.

Despite Escobar's relative physical maturity, there's power projection here based on his capacity for movement and contact quality. 
It's harder to reconcile his size with his defensive forecast. Though he's played all the infield positions but first base, it's tough for infielders with his build to stay at shortstop long-term. An agile, low-to-the ground athlete, he's a suitable infielder more in the 2B/3B mix. Here again we have a prospect whose ability to be an impact player will need to be driven by a premium hit tool, and the early indications are that this is plausible for Escobar. Given that he raked in the 2022 DSL and is more filled out that most teenage infield prospects, it was surprising to see Escobar repeat the DSL in 2023.

His strike-throwing track record is strong and long, and Birdsell has had two healthy seasons in a row during which he's maintained good velocity. One thing working against him in this regard is his style of pitching with his fastball. He has a riding mid-90s heater that he commands to the top of the strike zone consistently, but this isn't an efficient approach. Command consistency does not always extend to his secondary offerings, though Birdsell has a deep enough coffer of them to start.

Yorke had a great 2021 pro debut, then his 2022 was impacted by myriad injuries (turf toe, back stiffness, wrist soreness). He rebounded in 2023 against Double-A pitching, began 2024 in Portland again, and has hit his way to Worcester. Never an especially good second base defender, Yorke has begun playing some left field this year, and as soon as he looks comfortable out there, he'll be ready to play the part-time role that Romy Gonzalez and Rob Refsnyder are currently combining to play, though it's notable that he has pretty dramatic reverse splits throughout his minor league career. 
Yorke's hitting hands are very sexy, and his righty cut looks great despite his relatively mediocre bat speed and athleticism. He lacks huge top-end power and swing loft, but he consistently hits the ball hard, with a 46% hard-hit rate at Portland and a 55% mark so far at Worcester. A rare righty low-ball hitter, he might be tested by big league velocity; Yorke's tendency has been to inside out harder fastballs, which might be an indication he'll be late on those. The hitting talent in Yorke's hands is quite exciting, and while he's flawed and will have to come off the field for defensive reasons late in games, he's a well-rounded hitter whose game power might take a leap with an adjustment to his swing.

His delivery is a low-effort, repeatable, starter-like operation that also features a clean, medium arm circle before he releases from a high three-quarter slot. Arronde’s fastball has average life and sits 92-94 at present, but given how much projection his frame has and the repeatable nature of his delivery, it’s safe to anticipate it will be an average or better offering once his frame is fully done adding strength. He already shows flashes of being able to spot it to both sides of the plate, especially to the arm side. The 80-84 mph breaking ball tends to display slurve-like depth and shape, but he'll flash a sharper two-plane version on occasion. The headliner of the arsenal is a tumbling changeup that features late, sudden depth; it's the pitch that has the most bat-missing potential in his mix. He throws the cambio with the same arm speed as his fastball and will utilize it effectively against both left- and right-handed hitters. It’s heavily reliant on chase, but the action on the offering is late and pronounced enough to expect it to consistently carry about average chase rates even as he moves to the upper levels.

Ramirez's offensive performance tapered off with each subsequent promotion and his defense remains a bit unkempt. His receiving around the edge of the zone and raw arm strength are both fine, but Ramirez is currently pretty bad at picking balls in the dirt, and his slow exit from his crouch drags his pop times down into an average range. He isn't ready to be a big league defender just yet, but he isn't so bad to that I'm projecting him to first base. This is still a young catcher with rare power at a position where players tend to break late. He needs to stop chasing sliders and pulling off ones that finish on the outer edge of the plate; Ramirez's performance against sliders was his biggest problem after arriving in Somerset.

Make no mistake, Leasure's best pitch is his fastball, which also added a few grades worth of movement in 2023. Leasure's violent, vertical-slotted delivery generates big carry on his heater, giving it in-zone bat-missing ability. His fastball execution, both with regard to throwing strikes and the quality of them, is well below average, but the pitch is nasty enough for him to get away with that. His most-used secondary is currently a hard, upper-80s slider/cutter that has variable shape because of Leasure's mechanical inconsistency. It's a nasty, late-breaking pitch that will be an effective second weapon if he can spot it more consistently as he gets comfortable with his relatively new arm strength. I'm not sure the curveball will be able to usurp it even though it theoretically should tunnel better with his fastball. It's a 12-to-6 offering in the low-80s and looked about average in the AFL. 
A fastball like this should enable him to be more than just a generic middle reliever, but there's not quite enough secondary stuff to project Leasure as a setup man or closer on a contender. He stands a chance to work higher-leverage innings for the Sox in the coming season.",,"29950"

He is built like Michael Irvin and has an enormous power ceiling if he continues to fill out as he matures. Despite his lever length, De La Cruz is fairly adept at staying short to the inner third of the zone and making contact in there, though he often strides toward the third base line in order to do this and might be vulnerable to well-located sliders as he climbs. 
De La Cruz has shifted from playing the infield to the outfield in 2024 extended spring training. It would be interesting to see a long strider like this developed in center field, but his feel for the position is predictably raw. There are others (Catuy, Alpuria) from the complex-level group who have more speed and experience and are clearly better fits out there right now, so it might be tough for Abdias to develop in center; we have him projected to a corner.

Burkhalter was electric in his lone 2023 Grapefruit League appearance (up to 97, nasty upper-80s cutters with more depth when Burkhalter wanted it), but his final fastball (94.7 mph) and 18th pitch of the inning was three ticks slower then his first one (97.7 mph) and just two weeks later, the Braves announced Burkhalter needed Tommy John. 
Burkhalter rehabbed throughout 2023 and returned to an affiliated mound just before 2024 list publication. I saw one of his June Florida Complex rehab outings in North Port and he looked great. He was sitting 95-96, touched 98, and commanded the same 92 mph cutter/slider from before he blew out. His full-body, high-effort delivery is still evocative of a likely reliever, but it makes sense to see if his changeup can take a step forward or if the Braves can tease a second, more distinct breaking ball out of him. The 2025 season is Burkhalter's 40-man platform year and it's plausible Atlanta could decide to fast track him as a reliever in the middle of next year.",,"sa3020382"

He throws from a low three-quarters slot that assists in creating the nearly 20 inches of horizontal movement on his 92-96 mph two-seamer, which he is throwing a little harder than when he was in high school. Mueth's lengthy arm circle causes timing inconsistency that results in erratic command. He also lacks present feel for both of his secondaries, and both his slider and changeup tend to vary drastically in quality from pitch-to-pitch. The slider is a short 82-86 mph breaker that at times will show above-average teeth, while at others it has loose spin and lacks sharpness. His changeup will flash significant fade at its best, but it's even more prone to having limited action than the slider is. Mueth’s projected below-average command will be his biggest hurdle to remaining a starter long-term, but he's so loose and lanky that it's a no-brainer to keep him on a starter's development path. He's raw in most facets but also has a chance to throw very hard over time and develop a fastball in the style of a Tanner Houck or Camilo Doval, or any extremely low-slot pitcher you can think of.

His slider breaks late and his curveball has big time depth. Both of them are easily plus, while the rest of his skill set is below average. His delivery is more graceful than it is athletic and powerful (it looked like it regressed a bit at OSU), and scouts are split as to whether or not JWB is going to throw harder in pro ball. Pro teams don't consider Oklahoma State to be especially good at developing pitchers, so perhaps there's meat on the bone here, either in terms of coaxing more velo out of Watts-Brown by altering his mechanics or simply by helping him impart more effective movement on that pitch.

His stuff took a leap, with his fastball up about three ticks into the 97-99 mph range, while both of Hill's mid-80s secondary offerings flashed plus or better. 
Hill is nearly a sidearm thrower whose fastball tails. His slider has lacked the depth it needs to miss bats early in 2024, but some of his best Fall League sliders were incredible. His changeup also has a lot of tailing action, and the horizontal split between Hill's slider and his two other pitches forces hitters to deal with a tough combination of east/west movement, though his lack of command doesn't enable these pitches to consistently play to their full potential.

He doesn't locate it precisely, but he has feel for elevating it in general, which is fine considering its life. His curveball is a 12-to-6 downer with significant depth that blends well with his elevated four-seamers out of the hand. Baumeister's slider will show a couple of different shapes.

There’s also a fading changeup in the mix that he throws with good arm speed, with his best ones showing depth to go along with the horizontal action.

He entered 2022 as a potential breakout guy, but Blalock had Tommy John just before the season and never threw a pitch.

Milwaukee added Blalock to their 40-man roster after the season. 
Blalock is a below-average athlete and his long-ish arm action makes his delivery look somewhat relievery, but he has four viable pitches and starter-quality command. He'll show you a mid-90s downhill heater, two distinct breaking balls (which are tough to parse from Blalock's fastball and one another), and a mid-80s changeup that succeeds because of Blalock's command of it rather than its movement. Aspects of Blalock's upright delivery that detract from his fastball's effectiveness aid in hiding his breaking balls, which he can land for a strike when he wants. It's average stuff that sings because of Blalock's command, and he should be a José Urquidy type of backend starter who shifts into a long relief role on a great team's playoff roster.",,"26419"

Herz has an extreme crossbodied delivery that aids in deception and makes him a nightmare for lefty hitters to pick up. His stride direction looks more like Andy Pettitte’s pickoff move than it does a traditional delivery. His huge extension and deception allows a fastball that averages 91.5 mph to play above its radar reading when it’s located in the upper quadrants. Herz throws from a high three-quarters slot with a lengthy arm circle and a pronounced wrist hook. It's tough for him to repeat, and he struggles with walks. His slider ranges between 81-86 mph; it's a short, quick offering that is more effective at staying off barrels than it is generating high whiff totals. The headliner here is Herz’s changeup, which routinely has 10 mph of velocity separation from his fastball. It's thrown with identical arm speed, has late depth, and is capable of regularly slipping under the bats of both righties and lefties. His overall command falls short of a long-term starter role (though he continues to start in 2024), but Herz’s plus-plus changeup and passable fastball/slider give him leverage-reliever upside.","LssvDo6ZKq8","26389"

Mattison also has a vertical curveball that sometimes has some arm-side movement that makes it a weapon against both lefties and righties. He still only uses his tailing mid-80s changeup occasionally, but that pitch had an absurd miss rate against lefties in 2023, north of 50%.

He's chase prone but has the bat-to-ball skills to make up for this to some degree. Already quite physically mature and much less projectable than the typical 20-year-old corner outfield prospect, Gonzalez's short levers make him very difficult to beat within the strike zone, and he punishes mistake breaking balls. His squat, nearly maxed-out build helps contextualize his measured peak exit velocities (which are a 40 on the big league scale) and caps his future power projection because he doesn't have room for more mass on his frame.

His underlying contact and chase data have been very promising (6.5% swinging strike rate, 88.5% Z-contact%, 16% chase rate), but Marsee's case as a prospect is much stronger on paper than it is to the eye.

Pauley's gorgeous swing is similar looking to Corey Seager's, his lift-heavy style of hitting to Brandon Lowe's. He doesn't have huge raw power, but a 50 bat with actualized 45 or 50 raw power would make for a good big league hitter. But Pauley hasn't looked like that this year. His power output is way down, even in the PCL environment, and he isn't tracking the baseball to the contact point. Pauley also struggles to make strong, accurate throws to first base, and appears to be trending off of third and toward some combination of first base, second base and left field. He's played all four in 2024. How much of a rebound can we expect? It isn't as if Pauley's underlying data is terrible; he's still making a ton of contact in the zone and has roughly average raw power.

This isn't a guy hitting balls north of 110 mph or anything like that, but when Bliss makes contact it tends to be hard and he can spray it to all fields. He deals with a pretty substantial hole in the top half of the strike zone, where he is very vulnerable to fastballs and has been for a while, even when he was only striking out at a 17% clip in the mid-minors. Since he's joined the Mariners organization, Bliss' plate discipline has taken a pretty substantial leap. His swing rates haven't changed, but his chase rates (especially with two strikes) have come way, way down. It's not a premium offensive profile by any stretch, but if we line up all the game's primary second basemen, it's good enough for Bliss to be in the no. 25-40 range of that group right now. 
Bliss has continued to play some shortstop in the minors this year, but he doesn't have the arm to do it at the big league level and there are times when his arm is even an issue at second base.

He has a great strike-throwing track record in pro ball but doesn't have precise command, which is hindered by a long arm swing that disrupts his timing. So far he's been able to avoid walks in a way that we think merits continued development as a starter and puts him more squarely on the starter/reliever line. Choate's slider tends to be wide and sweepy, and can give left-handed hitters fits. The other secondary pitch in Choate's mix is a changeup that features very late depth and is an effective offering against both righties and lefties.

He then showed a substantial velo bump in 2023, as he averaged 95 mph across just shy of 40 affiliated innings. At a compact 6-feet tall, Martin is not built like a typical big league starter and he certainly hasn't proven he can maintain that kind of velocity across a starter's load of innings. He is, however, a pretty special on-mound athlete with a lovely arm action, and his fastball's underlying characteristics and movement (some which are aided by Martin's lack of size) should help it play even when Martin doesn't have peak velocity. Additionally, Martin has the makings of a fantastic breaking pitch in his two-plane slider, which also added several ticks of velocity last year and was often 84-86 mph. 
Apart from size, Martin checks every box you'd want a teenage pitching prospect to check. The context of his performance is important to consider, though, and until Martin has shown this kind of stuff across 100-ish innings (which we're probably two seasons away from actually knowing), it's reasonable to wonder whether or not he can. For every Marcus Stroman there are many more Deivi Garcías.

Avila's command hasn't been encouraging this year in Northwest Arkansas, but he's only 22 and has a track record of logging lots of innings, so it'd be premature to write him off as a starter. We're looking at a back-end starter ceiling, with it more likely that Avila ends up as a fastball/curveball combo reliever who could be a high-leverage type if the stuff ticks up significantly in shorter bursts.",,"sa3006507"

He's a career .273/.371/.447 hitter in the low minors and has always been a little old for the level, though that began to change in 2023 when he clubbed 19 homers in 95 Low-A games and ended the year with a month at the age-appropriate High-A Hudson Valley. 
Serna is only listed at 5-foot-6, but he's long and sinewy, and he swings incredibly hard for such a small player. He also moves the barrel around the zone with uncommon feel for someone who swings with this much effort and verve. There's some chase-driven risk here. Serna is swing-happy in any count, but he gets especially antsy in two-strike counts, when he chases over 40% of the time. 
Like a lot of other interesting position player prospects in New York's system, Serna's arm strength will likely limit him to second base at the highest levels. If his swing decisions prevent him from being an everyday second baseman, any kind of versatility would make Serna more rosterable as a utilityman; he's gotten quite a few left field reps in Mexico this winter. Despite his size and age, I like Serna's power projection more than most of the other little middle infielders in the system because of his build and the ferocity with which he swings. He's got a puncher's chance to be an everyday second baseman, but he's more likely a Dylan Moore type of role player.",,"sa3015579"

Simpson has posted incredible numbers since entering pro ball despite hitting for no power. He has a career .393 OBP and was promoted to Double-A about a month and a half prior to list publication. Simpson's lone career homer is an inside-the-parker. He has a slash-and-dash approach, poking grounders and liners down the third base line and hauling ass to first in under four seconds. The combination of his speed and awkward contact spray give infielders no margin for error, which is going to help Simpson reach more in the lower minors than he will against big league defenders. His swing is comically simple and compact, and he lacks lower body athleticism; Simpson just stays upright and slaps at the ball. He is very twitchy and able to reach his elite top speed quickly. This isn't a Steven Kwan situation even though Simpson's swinging strike rates are also right around 2% — Simpson's hitting hands don't look anywhere near as deft as Kwan's — but he is going to make a lot of contact and put a rare level of pressure on defenders with his speed. 
It's amazing that Simpson has performed like he has on offense while also changing positions. He was a bad college infielder but has mainly been manning center field for the Rays while mixing in appearances in left. His routes aren't always efficient, but his top-shelf speed helps to cover that up and he has enough range to handle center field at a solid-average level right now. If his feel progresses with continued reps, the ceiling on his defense is pretty big. Simpson is also an elite base stealer. He stole 94 bags combined between Tampa's A-ball affiliates in 2023 with an 86% success rate, which was a huge leap from his 60% college success rate. He's stealing just shy of a base per game in 2024. We don't think the quality of big league defense will allow Simpson's offense to play like it has so far and he won't be an ideal everyday center fielder. But what he will do is provide a turbocharged version of the bench outfield role, with elite pinch-running and situational hitting impact.",,"sa3020219"

So too did injury. Martinez had Tommy John in 2021, which put him in a bit of a developmental bind since he came back in the middle of 2022, his 40-man evaluation year, and only had a couple months to earn a roster spot. He did. After moving to the bullpen post-surgery, Martinez saw his sitting velo leap into the 97-100 mph range, and a brand new splitter not only gave him a plus secondary weapon, but might end up being even better than that. He made his major league debut for Arizona in 2023, throwing 10 innings after striking out just under 30% of opposing batters he faced in his 49.1 frames in the PCL. He began the 2024 season in Reno, but a rash of injuries to Arizona's pitching staff has foisted him into one of the more meaningful roles in the Snakes' bullpen. 
Martinez throws from a three-quarters slot and his plus arm quickness allows him to generate elite velocity with seemingly minimal effort. While the fastball is hard, Martinez doesn't consistently produce plus carry or riding life on the offering, and his command likely has a below-average ceiling at best, limitations that will impact his fastball's overall quality. His splitter comes out of his hand with bullet spin (but barely any spin at all), which sometimes makes it look like a slider when it finishes to his glove-side, though it often just has bat-missing sink. There are even times when Martinez will mis-release his splitter and it accidentally tails back over the glove-side corner of the plate, freezing hitters. It's easily Martinez's best secondary offering and is extra deceptive because of the arm speed that he maintains when throwing the split. At present, his feel for the offering is mixed at best, and it’s not uncommon for him to produce multiple uncompetitive ones during an at-bat. The last pitch in Martinez’s arsenal is a slider that relies more on how late it moves rather than its amount of movement; it has slight tilting action and average bite. He's been mixing it in early in counts to keep hitters off his fastball. Martinez’s pure stuff is that of a high-leverage reliever, but his control will need to improve more in order to achieve that role.","24n0n54plvI","24453"

To this point Walters has been a ""fastball-only"" pitcher, with close to 80% heater usage at Miami in 2023, which was actually down from 2022. His mid-90s college fastball had incredible riding life, generating tons of swings and misses throughout the strike zone, and in the 2024 Spring Breakout game with the Guardians, Walters was throwing even harder and touched 100. It's a dominant offering that could be enough to spearhead a high-leverage single-inning relief role in pro ball. Walters had no feel for finishing his slider/curveball in college and that offering desperately needs to be developed for him to hit his ceiling as a set-up man or closer. His slider has shown flashes of late, nasty movement early in 2024, but it's very inconsistent. Walters is pretty likely to be at least a middle reliever on the back of his fastball, and he has upside beyond that if he and the Guardians can find him a second plus pitch.","cOu5S6SDSCM","33834"

The super athletic little righty was among the hardest throwers in the 2023 DSL and his game is translating to stateside pro ball as he carves the Complex League in Florida. 
Matoma is now touching triple digits with his fastball and sitting 95-98 mph with ease. He looks like a reincarnation of Yordano Ventura, a supreme little athlete with arm speed that breaks the sound barrier.  He showcases a loose arm with a very projectable frame that might come into even more velocity as his body matures and adds strength. His command is far from precise, but Matoma throws enough strikes to warrant optimism that he can be developed as a starter, and the way his fastball plays won't require him to be super fine with his location. His slider’s quality is very volatile pitch to pitch. He often gets on the side of it, which hinders the spin tightness and the authority of its break and results in the 85-89 mph offering varying greatly in shape. The best ones have short,  three-quarters shape with late tilting action.
The foundation of a high-leverage relief prospect is already here, but we have no idea how to account for the way Matoma's baseball background might leave room for all kinds of development on top of what he's already doing. He's athletic enough to be optimistic that he'll eventually have a good changeup, too. This is a volcanic profile, a very talented athlete with huge arm speed who is great to have in the system.

His first pro season did not necessarily reinforce that view. Bonilla struggled with strikeouts in the DSL (24.3% K%) and his swing often looked disconnected, his footwork often mis-timed. We discussed sliding Bonilla below this FV tier (his pre-signing FV grade), but he still has a ton of power and is very young. His bat-to-ball performance was troubling enough that it has put us on a sort of notice here, though, and if it continues or worsens in 2024, we're poised to slide Bonilla more substantially. He's likely to be in Dunedin for extended spring training, so we won't have a meaningful amount of data in this regard until later in the summer.

During the early part of his return from TJ as a sophomore, Halvorsen played center field for the few weeks before the pandemic shutdown. He was exclusively a starting pitcher in 2021, then transferred from Missouri to Tennessee and transitioned to a multi-inning relief role in 2022. There have been a few key adjustments to Halvorsen's pitch mix along the way. He was fastball/curveball guy at Mizzou, threw more of a new splitter at Tennessee, and now with the Rockies he's throwing a few ticks harder than in college. Both during spring training and in Hartford early in 2024, Halvorsen has been parked in the 97-99 mph range. 
All three of his pitches can be nasty. Because he lacks precise command, both of Halvorsen's secondary pitches have a tendency to finish all over the place. His slider (84-87 mph) is hard enough to miss the barrel even when it backs up, and some of his mis-released splitters act like a two-seamer running off the front hip of lefties and catch the corner. Fernando Cruz, Scott McGough and Erik Swanson are fair present comps for the way Halvorsen is likely to operate, with his pitch usage spread across his whole mix so that unpredictability can help him get away with his mistake locations. He profiles as the third- or fourth-best reliever in a good bullpen, one who has experience getting more than just three outs and who has the pitch mix to do that. Halvorsen has become muscular to the point of being bulky, and his delivery is quite violent. I don't know that this means he's subject to elevated injury risk (the graceful guys get hurt too), but I do wince watching him throw. That hasn't impacted his grade here, but if I were a team, it would make me more open to an express lane trajectory to the big league club.",,"33294"

His four-seam fastball sits 92-95 mph with solid carry, in part due to his very compact arm swing and his ability to spin (2,500-plus rpm); the heater has proven to play far better when elevated and not so well in the zone. Nuñez’s secondary stuff is awesome. His best sliders have sharp, two-plane shape with late break, but because of his fastball's in-zone vulnerability, Nuñez more often uses his breaking ball as a way to get ahead of hitters. His least used pitch is a firm changeup at 85-88 mph that will flash unhittable late diving action. It's thrown with the same high-quality fastball arm speed and falls off the table when Nuñez releases it right. Too often, he'll throw changeups that are easily identifiable as balls out of hand. This likely speaks to both a lack of feel and confidence in this particular offering, which has immense potential but is the least likely to reach its projected grade. Nuñez has right tail outcomes in the rotation if his command and/or cambio takes a considerable leap forward. Currently working in a piggyback role in Aberdeen, it is more likely that Nuñez ends up as an inefficient but nasty long reliever.",,"sa3015464"

He has barely pitched in pro ball because the Brewers shut him down after he was drafted (which is pretty typical, especially in this org), he had a relatively minor elbow surgery early in 2022 that cost him most of the year, and further soreness nixed a planned Fall League stint at the end of that season. Henderson's 2023 got off to a delayed start to manage his innings, but he was dominant when he pitched. Across 18 starts at Low-A, including many second half starts of five or six innings, Henderson struck out 35% of opponents and had a 2.75 ERA. He did so despite sitting about 92 mph and using just two pitches, the other being his plus, screwball-style changeup. 
This spring, Henderson is throwing much harder, albeit in short outings. In his one Cactus League inning prior to publication, he was sitting 95-97. Context is important; Henderson is totally rested and worked just a single inning. But if Henderson is going to throw that hard for an inning at time, it could make sense to fast track him in relief since he might only be a reliever anyway. Henderson is a shorter guy with a high-effort delivery. He's thrown strikes as a pro, but he's also been hurt some and the look of his delivery is more typical in a bullpen. Then there's the issue of a third pitch, which Henderson is still searching for. He used an uphill cutter in 2023 but a source indicated to me that his breaking ball now has more slider shape in the 83-84 mph range. Whether or not that pitch is a hit this season might dictate which track Henderson ends up on, possibly by the middle of the year. His changeup is a pretty special pitch and, if paired with an uphill, mid-90s fastball for an inning at a time, is the sort of weapon you find on a higher-leverage reliever. I expect Henderson to be promoted very aggressively in 2024 because it's his 40-man evaluation year, and there's a chance it will make sense for Milwaukee to 'pen him late in the season and allow him to debut as a reliever in September without burning one of his options.",,"sa3020080"

Because he popped up late relative to his peers, most of the pool money when he was first eligible to sign had already been committed and he opted to wait a year so that more teams could pursue him with a meaningful bonus. The Padres signed him for $1.7 million and pushed him to camp in Arizona during 2022 minor league spring training, much earlier than other teams tend to move their recent signees (though of course, he was a little older). Susana had only pitched in eight official games on the complex before the Padres traded him to Washington as part of the Juan Soto deal. In 2023, he made 17 starts at Fredericksburg, where Susana struggled with walks and had an ERA north of 5.00. The same has been true in 2024 as he repeats Low-A. 
Susana's fastball features elite velocity, but its downhill angle and lack of movement make it shockingly hittable for a pitch that peaks at 103. It's not a given that the physically mature Susana will be able to sustain this level of arm strength when he's working a full slate of innings, but he has now shown he can hold it across a typical reliever's load. It's likely Susana will need to pitch more heavily off his slider in the future because of his heater's vulnerability. When it's right, his slider is already a plus pitch in the upper-80s, and it should mature as a plus-plus offering. Susana can vary his breaking ball shape and he has a splitter. Any realistic path to starting for Susana includes him developing much better feel for that splitter than he has right now. It makes sense for the Nationals to develop him as a starter for as long as possible, but it's much more likely that the barrel-chested Susana becomes a reliever akin to Brusdar Graterol.",,"sa3018808"

Graham has impressive all-fields power even though he's rail-thin, and his frame has room for another 15-20 pounds before compromising his mobility at short. He is an incredible athlete for his size, playing low-to-the-ground defense and showing big league-level comfort backhanding balls in the hole, hosing guys with his plus-plus arm. After he looked lost at the plate early during his junior year, Graham righted the ship and was much better during conference play, and he ended his college career hitting .320/.415/.584 while striking out 21% of the time. He has been conservatively assigned to Low-A Lakeland since signing with Detroit and hasn't exactly blown the doors off, as he's slashed .244/.341/.360 in 81 total games there, with his 2023 cut short by an abdominal strain. 
There are hit tool issues here that threaten Graham's whole profile. His pitch recognition (especially against sliders) and bat control aren't very good, and he tends to swing through a narrow band of the zone, not showing great tactile feel to hit. It's possible Graham will develop finer barrel control as he gets stronger and no longer has to incorporate his entire body to swing hard. That would perhaps help him move the barrel around with greater precision, but the slider recognition piece still looms. There are several hit tool bust risk indicators here, from Graham's lever length to his slider chase, and it might be foolish to continue to be seduced by hitters like this. But the high-end outcomes for Graham are exciting and huge, and I want to round up on how I'm valuing him even though he has a high-risk evaluation. So much of this is predicated on him staying at shortstop, the aspect of his profile I'm the most confident in.

Cespedes' swing path leaves him very vulnerable to fastballs in the upper part of the zone, but he's otherwise a dangerous all-fields hitter. He's carried his 2023 plate discipline improvement to High-A and this relatively new selectivity has helped him get to more of his power in games. He has plus strength and bat speed and is capable of hitting some titanic pull shots, especially if you hang him a breaking ball, and Cespedes has a hard-hit rate up around 50% as of list publication.

Fletcher made his big league debut in 2023 when Alek Thomas was sent back to Triple-A to rework his swing. He hit an impressive .301/.350/.441 in a 28-game big league stint, but his .263 xwOBA was considerably lower than his actual .340 mark. He has become surprisingly buff and strong for a 5-foot-9 hitter, his arms are gigantic for a person his size, and Fletcher has done so while retaining fluidity in his hips and shoulders, both of which are evident as he finishes his swing. The sweeping nature of his bat path means Fletcher does most of his extra-base damage against slow stuff he can scoop at the bottom of the zone. He inside-outs a lot of fastballs the other way, and pitchers can limit his damage by approaching him with heat. Contrary to the way he was projected in high school, he now has a power-over hit profile. 
Fletcher is an average runner from home to first and doesn't have the pure speed to play center field regularly, but his reads and routes out are good enough for him to moonlight there in an emergency.

His best pitch is his tailing upper-80s changeup, which has a great amount of movement but can suffer from Richardson's sudden lack of feel for location. He also has a loopy 12-to-6 curveball in the 79-82 mph range and a low-80s slider that he struggles to control. All of these pitches are fine on their own but none of them fits particularly well with one another, and this is exacerbated by Richardson's overall lack of control. It's possible he can improve his command as he gets further away from surgery, but based on Richardson's arm strength and injury history, it might be best to just bullpen him and let him try to bully opposing hitters in the middle innings.","A6viDU8LwwU","24581"

That hasn't really happened, and all of Estes' secondary pitches generate below-average swing-and-miss. He'll pepper the top of the zone with his cutter (which plays pretty well with his fastball up there) and show you a 78-82 mph slider that tends to finish on the plate. His secondaries tend to finish in the zone, which helps him avoid walks but hinders his ability to miss bats.

Ceballos began his college career at San Jacinto Junior College in Texas and was drafted in the 14th round as a sophomore by the Angels (he didn't sign) before transferring to Oregon for his junior year. In Eugene, Ceballos hit .333/.426/.643, accrued nearly as many walks as strikeouts, and had a great collegiate postseason; the Braves popped him 11 rounds sooner in 2023 than he had been taken the year before. 
Ceballos' skill set is headlined by his plus defensive actions and his huge arm. A balanced, low-to-the-ground athlete with great footwork, he has a strong, accurate arm from all kinds of odd platforms. His athletic style is more about body control than explosion, and this also applies to Ceballos' offense, which is driven by plate discipline and a compact swing. Though some of his best cuts look rather explosive, with Ceballos' bat finishing in the dirt behind him, he doesn't have the high-end raw power typical of a corner infielder. Because he also isn't a speedy, up-the-middle athlete, this may be an all-or-nothing situation at third base; it's tough to project Sabin as a utility guy. He'll need a combination of contact and OBP skills sufficient to clear the offensive bar of an everyday third baseman, which is plausible but unlikely. Ceballos' plate coverage and feel for all-fields contact is visually striking and his underlying swing-and-miss data (a 7% swinging strike rate as of list publication) corroborates it.

Clase is striking out a ton and wholly unable to get on top of high fastballs. But he's also incredibly strong for his size, he's an explosive rotational athlete whose swing often finishes with his bat in the dirt behind him, and he has the ability to dip-and-rip low pitches with authority. His feel for the outfield isn't great, especially on balls hit in front of him. Elite speed helps mitigate this issue enough to profile in center and will enable Clase to make an impact on the bases. Considering he's only 22, it's fair to allow for long-term projection on Clase's defense and his ability to hit, though more in a way that allows him to stick on a roster than be an everyday player. He's seen a smattering of big league time this season as an injury call-up.

Ahuna can spray pitches in the lower third of the zone to all fields, wielding doubles pop to both gaps, but his bat path naturally cuts underneath high fastballs, which are increasingly common. The length of his swing is going to make it tough for him to hit and we expect that his hit tool issues will persist. He is, however, a lock to stay at shortstop thanks to his hands, acrobatic actions, and arm, and he has a shot to be an impact defender there.

Because he's relatively new to pitching, it seemed feasible that Arias could develop a more potent third pitch and starter-quality command, but in 2024, the Cubs have moved Arias out of the rotation and into a multi-inning relief role at Double-A Tennessee. At a lanky 6-feet or so, Arias is fun to watch pitch because his stuff is nasty, his delivery is funky, he looks great in the uniform, and he has great taste in spikes. His low-slot delivery, which is similar to Luis Castillo's, creates huge tail and uphill angle on his 94-97 mph heater. He topped out at 98 in his last outing prior to list publication. Arias' upper-80s changeup has so much tailing movement that it sometimes doesn't entice opposing hitters, but it has the potential to be a special pitch. His mid-80s bullet slider can be terse and cutter-y, but it looks to have more length early in 2024 than in the past. 
Arias, who is on the Cubs' 40-man roster, threw just over 80 innings in 2023 and is on pace to pitch about that much again as he works about two innings every three days. This is Arias' first year on the 40-man. He was a Pick to Click in our Prospect Week fortune telling, but at that time, the notion that he'd continue to start was more realistic.

He had a great 2023 pro debut in the DSL and was off to such a hot start in the 2024 FCL that he was promoted to Low-A as an 18-year-old shortly before list publication. Hand soreness has delayed his Salem debut. 
With the acknowledgment that this guy's hand speed is pretty nutty and he can really bang, this scouting report also aims to caution folks against taking Cespedes' rookie ball performance at face value. He is very physically mature relative to other 18- and 19-year-old hitters; one might argue he's already become concerningly large for this stage of his career. Obviously he's so young that Cespedes and Boston's strength and conditioning program could make significant changes in this area, but his frame is maxed out right now and it impacts his mobility on defense enough that there's a chance he won't stick on the infield at all if he gets bigger the way people tend to as they age. It's reminiscent of Willie Calhoun at the same age. 
Cespedes is also a very aggressive swinger; over the course of four or five plate appearances, he might only see six or seven pitches. His bat speed and feel for contact are both special and have allowed him to thrive against rookie ball pitching despite this. Indeed, his talent in this regard is going to allow him to perform for a while despite other issues. At some point there will probably have to be an adjustment on Cespedes' part, especially if he ends up being a below-average defensive player and needs every drop of offensive production he can muster to root himself on a major league roster. Because defensive versatility probably won't be a thing here, Cespedes' outcomes are binary: Either he keeps hitting enough to be an everyday second baseman (becoming a better defender as he climbs) or he'll be tough to roster. I break from syllogistic reasoning a bit here having Cespedes ranked ahead of Chase Meidroth, who has proven he can hit despite other limitations in a way Cespedes hasn't yet. I think there's way more power potential here than Meidroth's profile could ever hope to have, and that's driving the flip.",,"sa3021085"

The movement of Aracena's fastball is all over the place. It tends to have natural cut, but it also flashes big tail. His delivery and level of athleticism aren't anywhere near this, but the same was true of complex-era Camilo Doval and Emmanuel Clase. Aracena and the Mets will need to polish and develop his fastball movement to lean into either the cut or tail, as the shape of the pitch as its currently constituted will cause it to play below its velocity. He appears poised to be developed as a starter, which makes sense given that you want him to work on these things. Still, based on his delivery and strike-throwing track record, Aracena is likely a reliever. Purely from a trade value standpoint, he probably belongs a bit lower on this list, as teenage pitchers carry risk and this one is still quite a way from the big leagues.

Tena's swing has a hitch that often causes him to swing underneath in-zone fastballs, and he peppers the third base line with slasher-style contact because he's often a little too late to do pull-side damage, where his power is biggest. Also a fairly aggressive hitter, the OBP aspect of Tena's game is likely to be below the big league average as well. 
Tena doesn't necessarily have the defensive skill set to be projected as a utility man. His exchange is incredibly quick, but the other aspects of his defense (especially his range) are not a comfortable shortstop fit, and while he's played all over the infield, he fits best at second base and might be landlocked there. Right now I have Tena evaluated as an above-replacement second base option rather than an on-roster role player. As his options run out while other middle infielders ascend through the org, rival teams looking to be active on their roster margins should be sensitive to Tena's presence on Cleveland's 40-man bubble and consider how their dev group might help to get his swing on time such that he pulls the ball more often.

His 2023 was shortened and likely compromised by an injury to his wrist that necessitated season-ending surgery. Veen rotates with rare ferocity, and his broad-shouldered, 6-foot-3 frame leaves room for immense strength as he matures, projection he began to actualize in 2022. As explosive as most of his body is, Veen's hands are not, and he tends to be long into the hitting zone. The length of Veen's swing makes it very difficult for him to catch up to fastballs and limits the locations in the zone where he can do damage. Pitchers work him in on the hands, then get him to swing over the top of back-foot breaking balls once Veen starts to cheat on heaters in that spot. Against the fastballs at 94 mph or above that Synergy Sports has tracked since 2022, Veen has hit .146 with a .171 SLG. Some of this is likely due to the wrist injury, but isolating his performance to 2022 still has him hitting below the Mendoza Line. Veen is habitually late on heaters and really only able to impact ones down-and-away from him when he can get his arms fully extended. 
So much else of what Veen brings to the table is exciting and potentially impactful. He is going to wreak havoc on the bases. He plays with an elite motor, moves from base to base with just a few gigantic strides, and commits to the next base with abandon in borderline situations. He added meaningful muscle and strength during the 2022-23 offseason, and has made several adjustments to his swing across the last few seasons, some seemingly because he was trying to deal with injury and others to try to solve his contact and lift issues. He has the straight line speed to play center field but defenders with better feel have pushed him to a corner in the minors. He is most similar to D-backs outfielder Jake McCarthy and Braves outfielder Forrest Wall, with the skillset of a premium fifth outfielder who most often impacts the game with speed, except Veen has more raw juice and in-game power potential in the event that he makes a successful swing adjustment.","lgqbYc_lNLg","sa3014516"

He tracks pitches well and guides the barrel to them consistently but he's now going on two consecutive years of below-average offensive performance due not only to a lack of power but because the quality of the contact he makes isn't enough to shoot the baseball past infielders. He's been a low BABIP guy to this point because of this. Bencosme's bat-to-ball skills are still among the best in this system, and while he's been a mediocre offensive performer the last couple of seasons, he has done so as a young-for-the-level hitter.

His front side is a little stiff through the contact point, but Pratt rotates with verve through the hips and hit the ball with power on the showcase circuit.

It forces Soto to pitch more heavily off of his promising secondary pitches, which he doesn't have the command to execute consistently right now. Soto struggles to work efficiently, running deep counts due to an inconsistent release and foul ball after foul ball against his fastball. His slider is nasty. It will span the 83-87 mph range and has late bite. Right now, however, Soto is throwing a ton of changeups, as if it's a developmental priority. It was an inconsistent pitch in high school and remains so, lacking movement a lot of the time. 
While in high school he had some bodily and mechanical similarities with same-age Bryan Mata (mature frame, a relatively low slot but with an upright lower half), Soto and Minnesota's strength and conditioning program have made some positive progress. Soto looks leaner and twitchier in 2024 than when he was an amateur. He has such big arm speed that it's unreasonable to expect Soto to have touch-and-feel command right now. We can project on his control and changeup a fair bit here, but the fastball shape problem might be harder to solve, as Soto might have to locate it more precisely than we can reasonably project in order for it to be an impactful pitch. We still think the $2.5 million Minnesota laid out for Soto was pretty steep given his particular issues, but he's already improved on some of that stuff.

The rate of player defections from Cuba has significantly diluted the quality of pitching in pro ball down there, so it was difficult to gauge Prieto's hit tool with precision. He defected from the Cuban National Team not long after arriving in Miami for an Olympic qualifier in May of 2021 (there's a riveting <em>Sports Illustrated</em> story that details his ""extraction""), and he signed a $650,000 deal with the Orioles at the beginning of the 2022 international signing period. The Cardinals picked up Prieto when they traded Jack Flaherty to Baltimore last year and he’s continued to put his plus hit tool on display. 
In 2023, he had a total of 540 plate appearances between Double- and Triple-A and posted a .323/.367/.446 slash line while limiting his strikeout rate to 9.3%, and he's off to a hot start to 2024 as well. Prieto's hit tool almost completely defines his offensive output, though. He draws a below-average number of walks — he had a 5.6% walk rate last season and a 4.7% rate for his career — and has below-average game power at best. He’s an average defender at both second base and the hot corner, but he isn't capable of handling shortstop in a way that would facilitate more of a super-infield utility role. Prieto continues to track as an Eric Sogard type who is a solid bench player for a competitive club.","lpeRTYs8S6Q","sa3018100"

Despite that, his athleticism and mouth-watering pitch data were enticing enough for the Sox to draft him in the second round anyway. We wondered if aspects of Pallette's delivery would be altered during his rehab in order to help his fastball play a bit better, but when he returned his delivery looked more or less the same as it had prior to surgery, which is to say that it's still rather violent and his arm action is still on the longer side. Adjustments to his delivery may be necessary if Pallette keeps walking hitters at a nearly 13% clip like he did in 2023.
Pallette made 22 starts at Low-A last season, with his fastball sitting 92-95. That's not quite the peak pre-surgery arm strength that made him a potential top 15 pick, but it's still hard enough to project him as a big leaguer. Pallette's curveball is still a plus, high-spin offering to the eye, but this is a situation where the pitcher's fastball plane and curveball shape don't seem to mesh, and Pallette's changeup is now generating better results. His cambio has a ton of arm-side action and should mature into a plus pitch if it isn't already. The raw movement of Pallette's secondary stuff is exciting, but he needs to throw more strikes, and he might also need to make some other changes so his breaking ball's results can match its visual beauty.

On offense, Flores is a relatively slow-twitch swinger with below-average bat speed and a very conservative approach. He tracks pitches pretty well, but his ball-striking power is near the bottom of the scale. Still just 18, Flores was skipped over the Arizona Complex League and sent straight to Low-A to start 2024.

He underwent Tommy John surgery just before the shutdown in 2020, though that didn't deter the Mets from selecting him in the second round of that year’s draft. He was traded to Oakland for Chris Bassitt before the 2022 season. Forearm soreness cost him a chunk of that season, and he showed reduced velocity and poor command upon his return, only to be shut down two more times in quick succession with forearm soreness last year. Early on in 2024, Ginn has more often been in the 92-95 mph range and his command has rebounded. He has a drop-and-drive delivery and a vertical arm slot, but he tends to work with sink and not ride, atypical of a delivery like his. The latter part is most important because Ginn needs to have pinpoint command for his modest secondary stuff to play. He has an average 83-85 mph slider, can lob his curveball in the zone for a strike, and has a firm, upper-80s changeup that he doesn't yet have feel for post-injury.

The Kiwi Rake is similar to Bergolla, just not as good a defender. He was perhaps the Phillies' most exciting complex-level prospect in 2022, as he made searing all-fields contact throughout extended spring training and then again during the complex season proper, walking as much as he struck out and barely ever swinging and missing. He's a compact, short-levered lefty stick with fantastic barrel feel and hand-eye coordination, as well as enough physicality to do doubles damage right now. Additionally, Pouaka-Grego has a coherent two-strike approach, ditching his leg kick once he's deep in counts, spoiling tough pitches, and grinding away at opposing pitchers until he gets something to put in play. Because he is not physically projectable, it's likely that NPG's hit tool will need to carry most of the water if he's going to be an impact player, but all the early-career indicators here suggest that's plausible. While Pouaka-Grego is short, he isn't small, and his lower body is especially muscular and strong, so he's not in danger of lacking big league physicality as much as it's tough to project that he'll have big raw power at maturity.","LEmUdrRfsno","sa3018959"

Brzykcy does not have good fastball control. He's a grip-and-rip type of guy whose heaters often sail to his arm side because they have so much carry. His low-80s power curveball flashes bat-missing depth and his upper-80s changeup will occasionally have enough arm-side action to do the same, but Brzykcy's feel for both is even less consistent than that of his fastball. Monster uphill fastball carry is the driver of his profile and he doesn't have to be fine with his location for it to play.

Lower back stiffness sidelined him for most of 2023 and those issues have persisted into the start of 2024. When he was finally deemed healthy in the middle of May, the Red Sox effectively skipped Romero over Low-A (he only played there for a month last year) and sent him straight to Greenville. 
Romero still has a good looking low-ball swing and the explosive hitting hands that made him an exciting draft prospect. His mobility on defense isn't great, and he takes quite a while to turn the baseball around to first base. His throwing stroke and accuracy also look a little odd (Romero has an over-the-top arm slot atypical of an infielder), and he takes a while to get rid of the baseball.

Romero's 40-man timeline is such that he and Boston have through the 2026 season to get things on track; that's still plenty of runway.

Like his fastball, Klein's ability to harness his breaking ball and cutter in the zone is hit and miss, and results in him being a little too reliant on opposing batters chasing out of the zone. Klein is tracking towards a single-inning middle-relief role, with a chance of holding down a higher leverage spot if he can cut down on the free passes.",,"27787"

He has been held to fewer than 50 actual games across his first year and a half of pro ball due to a labrum tear, which occurred pretty much right after he was drafted and required surgery, and then quad and hamstring issues that plagued his 2023. When Jones has played, he has looked good on defense but wholly overmatched and uncoordinated at the plate. 
Jones' swing has been a mess so far as a pro. He has difficulty recognizing sliders and is struggling to pull the ball even more than when he was in high school, often inside-outing pitches around his hands to the right side of the infield. As of list publication, Jones' swing is so ill-timed that he has whiffed twice as often as he's put balls in play. For context, an <em>even</em> ratio would be concerning. It's possible that rust from his time away due to injury is part of why Jones' issues at the plate look so severe, but they are rather concerning and badly need to improve if he's going to be an impact big leaguer. Thankfully, Jones is still such a good center field defender that, even if his bat has bottomed out for good, he'll likely still eventually play a meaningful big league role in the Brenton Doyle/Trayce Thompson vein, and someone like Michael A. Taylor would be a comp for what we think his best power seasons could still look like. His range, ball skills, arm strength and arm accuracy are all fantastic, and so long as his 6-foot-4 frame doesn't slow down too much as he matures, Jones is going to be a special defender. This situation might start to have a Ben Simmons vibe if things don't get better soon, with the online hype machine bearing some of the blame for setting expectations too high with comparisons to Druw's dad and click-churning viral clips.","jMTQBz131dE","sa3020676"

His measureable exit velocities from 2023 were a tick below the big league average, which is fabulous for a shortstop this age. His pretty, low-ball swing tends to be vulnerable to hard, high fastballs, which Osorio really hasn't seen a ton of yet, and already his contact rates are in a somewhat discouraging place. The influential skill variable here is going to be Osorio's defense. He's a skill-based fit at shortstop right now but as he fills out, he might slow down and move to third.

After a couple years of pro ball it's now pretty clear that Watson is going to be limited to second base on defense (while he still played a lot of shortstop last season, he doesn't have the arm for it) and has fairly severe swing-and-miss issues, but he remains an incredible rotational athlete who generates explosive pull-side power for a hitter his age.

Jorge and the Rockies decided it was mutually beneficial to wait until the next period to ink a $2.8 million deal, a Rockies' record and one of the largest bonuses in the class. As most Cuban signees do even though they're often a little older, Jorge spent his first pro season in the DSL for tax purposes. At age 20, he was a bit old for his 2023 complex-level assignment and torched pitching there. I got overzealous and prematurely elevated Jorge, who has immense physical projection and a body in the Fernando Tatis Jr. mold, into the back of the Top 100. 
As he's been promoted to full-season affiliates some of his issues have become more apparent. He's more smooth than explosive and doesn't have the arm strength or range to comfortably project at shortstop, though he does have the flexibility and actions. His inside-out swing makes it difficult for Jorge to turn on anything and it might be tough for him to actualize whatever power he grows into because of the way his mechanics work. His bat-to-ball track record has been impressive even though his swing is atypical. I'm skeptical that will continue, but I'm still sky high on Jorge's long-term power projection because of his build. I'd like to see him tried in center field and will be keyed to identify a swing change if the Rockies make one.

He made it just a month into 2022 before he was shut down with an elbow injury, and was later traded from Tampa Bay to Baltimore at the 2022 deadline as part of the elaborate, multi-team Trey Mancini swap. Johnson had Tommy John just a few days afterward. The Orioles were willing to use a 2023 40-man spot on a rehabbing Johnson, who returned to an affiliated mound in mid-August, barely a year after his surgery. 
Johnson's stuff has been intact since his return, as he once again sat in the mid-90s throughout starts that rarely exceed four innings. At this point, it's fair to project Johnson as a reliever. He's 25 and aside from this year hasn't been fully healthy since 2021. His fastball plays down a tick due to its plane and Johnson's lack of command.

Like Mayo, Adams' size limits his mobility at third base enough to put his future there in doubt. Also like Mayo, Adams has a kind of ridiculous swing that seems to be working for him. He slashed .233/.400/.401 as a 19-year-old at Low-A last year, stole 30 bases and hit 11 homers. Adams' underlying hit data is even better than that. His contact metrics — 8% swinging strike rate, 83% in-zone contact — were impressive for a teenage hitter Adams' size and his measured power — 41% hard-hit rate, 112 max exit velo — even more so. The gap between Adams' spreadsheet power and his actual 2023 slugging was pretty substantial, indicating a 2024 breakout could be looming. 
But will Adams' swing hold water against upper-level pitching? He has a comically large leg kick and low hand load in the Yermín Mercedes mold, and his swing is bottom-hand dominant, covering the bottom of the zone. There's an awful lot going on and there are reasonable doubts about Adams' ability to time all the component parts as he climbs. And if he ends up moving to first base permanently, it's possible none of this will matter because he'll need to find another gear of offense to be a meaningfully good player at that position. Adams is off to an exciting start for a guy who signed for a little less than $300,000 a couple of drafts ago; he was already a good pick. That context can give us a sort of whiplash where we overvalue the player because of how much better things are going than anticipated and I'm being careful not to do that with Adams, who I now value on par with a second round prospect.",,"sa3020135"

He covered both of Minnesota’s A-ball affiliates in 2023, throwing 84.1 frames of 2.88 ERA ball and striking out 79 batters while only walking 19. He got off to a great start at Cedar Rapids again and was quickly promoted to Wichita, where Morris has continued to avoid walks but has dealt with a dip in strikeouts. He has a medium frame that has room for added weight but probably not enough to project velo growth. 
Morris' delivery is weird. He has a high front side throughout his delivery and creates a slight crossfire angle with his stride direction before throwing out of a high arm slot. It's rare for cross-bodied pitchers to also have a north/south arm slot this extreme and it seems to disorient hitters. Morris' four-seamer has been sitting 92-96 mph in 2024 and holds its plane very well, which allows it to sneak past hitters' bats in the zone at a high rate. He has two distinct breaking balls: a 74-79 mph curveball that is a deep, gradual breaker, while the slider is a sharper, sudden two-plane downer at 84-88 mph. Morris will throw his changeup to both left- and right-handed hitters, and it now projects to be an average offering for him if he’s able to maintain the fade and sink it currently flashes. The 87-92 mph cutter shows effectiveness in crowding left-handed hitters with its late movement. This is an atypical mechanical look for a starter, but the pitches are there. We feel pretty confident Morris is going to be an impact arm of some kind, be it in long relief — where his deception could make him dominant across multiple innings like peak Yusmeiro Petit — or as a shorter-outing no. 4/5 starter.",,"sa3020569"

He steadily climbed through the Red Sox system and had an incredible beginning to the 2023 season with six starts at Double-A, during which he boasted a 0.82 WHIP and allowed just five total earned runs. Due largely to his lack of precision working in the strike zone, his stat line sagged upon a promotion to Triple-A, as Droahn's HR/9 grew more than sevenfold. Eleven of the 19 dingers he allowed at Charlotte came on belt-high beach balls. While his in-zone swing-and-miss took a tumble, his chase rate stayed in the mid-30s across both levels, and although he throws his slider more often, his changeup is his standout secondary in this regard, with a combined chase rate across the two levels of around 46%. He rarely threw the pitch to lefties, but righties struggled mightily against it, posting just a .154/.236/.262 slash line against the cambio in Drohan’s 89 innings post-promotion. Drohan’s Triple-A struggles were the first obvious stumbling block of his professional career, and if he can regain the command that allowed him to dominate at the lower levels, he could earn a role as a back-end starter.

The slingin' low-slot lefty has had an uneven 2024 and is running an ERA over 6.00 as of list publication. He has often worked only about three innings per outing and even has some single-inning relief appearances in the mix. His delivery evokes Madison Bumgarner's long lefty arm stroke, but Solometo doesn't have quite the same bodily looseness or arm strength. Many of his fastballs are erroneously auto-tagged as changeups because they're so slow. His delivery creates an odd angle on a mid-80s cutter/slider that Solometo commands to his glove side. That pitch plays up against lefties for reasons that are probably obvious, but it isn't a nasty pitch in a vacuum. Righties get a nice long look at everything Solometo does, and he could be very platoon-vulnerable against big leaguers. That makes changeup development, or anything that might help him deal with righties, important. It's tough to assess Solometo's changeup growth from an objective standpoint because his data sample is muddied by those mislabeled fastballs. On tape, it's a slightly below-average offering that projects to average because of Solometo's overall feel for location, which has come and gone a little bit this year but has otherwise been great for his entire prospectdom. Overall, his stuff is still far too light to consider him the mid-rotation type of pitcher, which has been true for a while now.

Defensively, Doughty split his time between second and third base, mostly at the latter. He’s a high-effort infielder, and his arm accuracy isn't great, particularly from across the diamond. His range and arm are a better fit at second base, but even there, his throws can be a bit wild on plays where he doesn't have time to plant his feet. He’s yet to firm up a defensive home, but his bat is advanced enough that even as a nomad, he could be a valuable addition to the lineup, especially if he can show a less aggressive, more intentional offensive approach.

Last season, they moved him back to the bullpen, where he had a two-tick velo bump and started working more with a sinker. His groundball rate spiked and has remained strong in the big leagues. Kolek will whip out the occasional four-seamer, and this plus his slider is how he tends to miss a bat, which he doesn't do a ton. Instead his sinker and cutter generate weak contact. It's great to have this guy in your bullpen for when you need a groundball. He's poised to be a lower-leverage part of San Diego's 'pen for a while.",,"21487"

He was seen a ton as a junior because he played at IMG, which was home to a lot of 2021 draft prospects and served as competition for others. Scouts were blown away by his power and speed, but Green's swing-and-miss issues were a huge concern. He struck out in a third of his varsity at-bats in 2021, and swung and missed more than he put balls in play during that year's summer/fall showcase circuit. Things improved during his senior year much in the same way you'd expect them to if a player were repeating a minor league level for a second consecutive season, but there was still a ton of strikeout-related bust risk here. Enamored with his tools, the Nationals drafted Green fifth overall and gave him just shy of $6.5 million to sign. 
He has struggled badly with strikeouts so far in pro ball, punching out over 40% of the time. When he does make contact, Green is vaporizing the baseball, producing elite peak exit velos for a hitter his age, but there's virtually no precedent for a hitter striking out this much in A-ball and succeeding in the big leagues. Only a few current major league hitters have in-zone contact rates as low as Green's (his 53% contact rate is even worse than Cristhian Vaquero's) and none of them struck out anywhere near this much in the low minors, instead seeing their strikeouts tick up  as they climbed and reached the big leagues where the best pitchers live. Especially because Green, who would produce the occasional 70-grade run time in high school, has already filled out and looks like he has no chance to stay in center field (though he plays his ass off), it feels like he's already on thin ice. You're essentially hoping Green turns into a righty-hitting version of Joey Gallo, where there's enough power to support a 20-grade hit tool. That's feasible, but isn't likely.",,"sa3020210"

On paper, that looks like high-end command, but the eyeball scouting report doesn't corroborate that. Gipson-Long lives in or near the zone because his line to the plate is so assertive and direct, but he doesn't have surgical touch-and-feel command, especially of his fastball. 
Built like a statuesque quarterback, Gipson-Long takes a big, cross-bodied stride toward the plate, and works from a low-three-quarters arm slot that imparts sink and tail on his low-90s fastball. Hitters who struggle with low-slot righties aside, Gipson-Long's fastball is fairly hittable, especially once opponents get a feel for his delivery. This is why he might be best suited for long relief, where he can lean even more heavily on his secondary pitches (his slider has big two-plane action, his changeup sinks a ton) and be a less efficient strike-thrower without knock-on effects for the rest of the pitching staff.",,"26048"

His feel for location is so raw that he has a little more relief risk than a typical $3-million signee, though sometimes guys with lanky frames like this gain control of their bodies later. 
Ferris has a powerful lower half, bending deep into his blocking leg. He also strides open, clearing his front side to help enable an extremely vertical arm slot. The combination of the two helps Ferris' fastball have flatter angle than is typical for a pitcher this tall and with such a high arm slot. If he can live more consistently at the top of the strike zone as he matures, his mid-90s fastball could dominate up there. The vertical slot helps him create depth on his breaking balls, and Ferris can turn over a changeup from that slot, albeit with some slot variation. He threw his changeup less than I expected last season and the quality of that pitch was a little worse than my pre-draft grades. The Dodgers have done a great job developing changeups and that pitch may yet take a leap in pro ball. Ferris' style of pitching with his fastball is such that he will probably always be an inefficient operator, but he has the raw stuff to be a no. 4 starter if he can improve his changeup and command.

He missed spring training due to a groin injury, returning to the mound in early June and struggling to maintain his excellent performance from the season before. In 2022, he held opposing offenses to one or fewer earned runs in more than half of his starts with Double-A Rocket City, but he accomplished that feat in only five of his 17 starts in 2023, and he got shelled after he was traded to the White Sox. In particular, he has lost much of his ability to garner swings below the strike zone, which accounted for much of his success in 2022. 
There have been points in Bush's prospect past when he's thrown very hard, but last season his heater averaged just 92.5 mph and his fastball became incredibly hittable. Unless his arm strength rebounds, Bush will need to make effective and strategic use of his secondaries to hold down a big league role. His mix includes a slider that flashes above average, a mid-70s curveball with enough movement to play as a strike-getter in the zone, and a changeup that seemed the rustiest of his offerings after missing time. Bush ramped up the usage of his changeup after arriving in Birmingham post-trade. He wants to pepper the area at the top of the strike zone with his heater and then bury his two breaking balls off of that, but his fastball doesn't get enough chase for him to do this efficiently. He could pitch backwards with his breaking stuff and then use his fastball as a finishing pitch above the zone (the more velo the better), but any way you slice it, if he's only sitting 92, he's more likely to find his way into the bullpen as a multi-inning reliever than he is to profile as a starter.","MQVab799buY","29823"

Perhaps the biggest development from Jorge's 2023 was that he began to see time in center field. He isn't a very good defensive second baseman and viability in center field is his best shot at developing into a good defender at a premium position.

The apex of Moore’s stock came while he was a sophomore at Arkansas, when he looked like a potential top 10 or 15 pick for the following year’s draft. He had a substantial downtick in performance as a junior and there was a rumor at the time that he might go back to school to try to recoup some draft helium with an age-21 senior season. Instead, Moore signed with the Brewers for $800,000 as a second rounder. 
He spent 2023 at High-A Wisconsin, where he slashed .233/.321/.361.

He quickly made developmental strides working out in the Dominican Republic. Miller was peaking in the low-90s as an amateur, but in his first pro season, he was sitting in that range and up to 96. His delivery features some head violence, but Miller is a projectable lefty with a naturally riding fastball and the potential to develop breaking stuff with big depth because his arm slot allows him to get over the top of the baseball. His fastball has nearly perfect north/south action, he can land his breaker in the zone, and he has some feel for creating tumble on a crude changeup. It's exciting raw material that will take time to harness, and Miller's development is being slow-played as he's back in the DSL for the 2024 summer.
As a hitting prospect, Miller had the worst contact rate among the Marlins' DSL hitters last year. He can really swing it, but doesn't track pitches well or move the barrel around. As long as he's on an innings count that allows for him to hit some of the time, it makes sense to develop him both ways to ensure the Marlins are making the right decision about which road he should take when Miller comes to the fork.

He threw it more than any of his non-fastball/slider offerings in 2023 and also showed improvement in the strike-throwing department.

That issue pervades his entire mix and is standing between him and a big league role in the relatively short-term. He's had very high walk rates his entire career and that hasn't subsided with San Diego.

His early pro look has been somewhat troubling. Morales has been chase prone, has underlying contact issues, and has quickly trended down the defensive spectrum. Now playing first base most often, Morales grew to about 225 pounds at Miami, and his large, strong, nearly maxed out frame could make a regular return to third base difficult. There’s notable length in Morales’ swing and he employs a low-slot hand entry that greatly hinders his ability to adjust within the zone. His chase and contact rates have both been comfortably below average so far as a pro and Morales has had trouble getting to his home run power, though we believe that part of his profile is still strong and a key to him having any big league role at all. Nearly all of Morales’ profile hinges on his in-game power production, and it’s hard to see him putting up the necessary offense to warrant an everyday role at first base.

Surgical command weaponizes the length of Dollard's slider, the quality of which some pitch metrics indicate is elite, though visual evaluations have it as merely above average.

He ended up working 100 innings as a starter and climbed from Low- to Double-A throughout the year, with his walk rate ticking up toward the end. He opened the 2024 season in the Richmond starting rotation, but to us he still comes off as more of a reliever long-term. 
Birdsong has significant length in his arm path that often hampers the timing of his release and command, though it also creates some deception because of how long he hides the ball from batters. He's relied more on his 12-to-6 curveball in 2024, which routinely shows above-average teeth but is very reliant on chase. It's a pitch that pairs better with his four-seamer than his slider does because of its significant depth. He can throw it out of the same tunnel as his elevated four-seamer, but presently the pitch ends up in the dirt more often than not, and major league hitters will just eliminate it if he isn't able to show he can land it for a strike with greater frequency. He's still utilizing his late-tilting slider, but it hasn't shown sharpness as consistently so far this year (its chase and miss rate stats were great in 2023) and seems to have taken a bit of a backseat to the curveball usage wise. Birdsong will also throw a changeup that often lacks notable action, and while it will show some slight depth on occasion, it projects as a show-me pitch at best. It was exciting how quickly Birdsong appeared to be developing last year, and there are still changes being made to his pitch mix, but his command has plateaued. We think Birdsong profiles as a single-inning reliever, a role where his stuff can play up in short bursts and his limited command is less of a factor.",,"31635"

This season, he started the year in Double-A, where he struck out 48 batters in 36 innings before being promoted to the rotation in Omaha.

Champlain has a medium arm circle with a clean path, and he throws from a high release point that generates solid backspin and carry on his 93-96 mph four-seam fastball. When Champlain is working his heater near the top rail of the zone, it holds its plane well enough to stay above the swings of opposing hitters and generate whiffs, but it lacks that same hop when it isn't elevated. His 78-81 mph curveball is a vertically oriented 2,700 rpm breaker that routinely shows above-average tightness, and it's ideal for tunneling off of his elevated fastball. The other breaking ball in his arsenal is a short-tilting slider at 83-87 mph that shows solid bite on occasion. Champlain's changeup (84-89 mph) mostly shows minimal, low-impact action in the form of slight fade that batters have an easy time identifying. 
Champlain's mix matches up well against same-side hitters, but his changeup quality lags behind his other pitches to such a degree that he'll be forced to lean heavily on his fastball/curveball combo when facing left-handed hitters.

He dealt with a couple periods of injury culminating in a Tommy John surgery in late May of 2021 that kept him out for the entire 2022 college season. He threw a bullpen for scouts near the end of the college calendar and then threw again at the 2022 Combine, in both instances sitting 92-94 mph with a more consistently short arm action than he showed before he blew out.

Prielipp did not pitch at an affiliate after signing with the Twins but was nails during 2023 spring training. Specifically, his slider was spinning with its usual 3,000-ish rpm, but it had added a few ticks of velocity and suddenly resided in the upper-80s, which is rare for a pitch that spins that fast. Prielipp's changeup also looked better than it did in college. The shorter arm action helped him sell it better than he was able to at 'Bama, arguably giving Prielipp a greater chance to start than was thought before the draft. It took all of 6.2 innings for him to blow out again, and he had the internal brace style elbow procedure in July of 2023.

He's throwing a bit harder this year, touching 96 and sitting 92-95 after he averaged 92 mph in 2023. Tong's fastball has plus-plus vertical ride and pure north/south shape with the tiniest bit of cut. It's an impact fastball that is going to miss bats at the top of the zone. The rest of Tong's repertoire is still in flux. He used a slow curveball as his primary offspeed weapon until this year when he's incorporated a slider, which is still very much a work in progress. It can be tough to turn over a changeup from Tong's vertical arm slot, so it's pretty important for that slider to progress. This is definitely an arrow-up prospect in the Mets system but you still have to project quite a bit to see the components of a big league starter here, and the frail-looking Tong needs to show he can sustain this level of velocity across a starter's load of innings. At this juncture, his best role looks like more of a long reliever, as it would give Tong a better chance to sustain this arm strength and lean heavily on his lone impact pitch once through the order.",,"sa3022324"

He posted an impressive 17.7% strikeout rate during that time that he nearly matched in walks (15.4%). He was stationed behind the dish in 23 of those games and saw opposing baserunners swipe 33 bags on him, as his arm is only so-so for a catcher.

He didn't produce anything close to the typical in-game power output of a big league first baseman, in part because his bat path caused him to drive the ball into the ground fairly often, à la Hosmer. 
Morgan has not only changed his swing pretty dramatically but has also begun using a bat with a counterweighted knob. He has a leg kick now and his hands are loading lower, and this has led to an uptick in his in-game power without sacrificing much of Morgan's above-average bat-to-ball ability. As you'd expect with a hitter who was battle-tested by the SEC, Morgan clubbed his way from Low- to High-A pretty quickly and he's continued performing at Bowling Green. He has an oppo-driven approach, staying inside the baseball across most of the zone and really only pulling the ball when it's on the inner third. Morgan remains rather chase-prone and his in-game power uptick is more about his swing path and playability than prototypical raw juice.

He's still very young and I want to be mindful of early onset prospect fatigue here — Cam has been known for going on a half decade now even though he won't turn 20 until after the season — so I've tried to strip down my previous notes and scout Collier from scratch, as if he weren't already a famous, high-bonus guy. 
Collier has incredible raw power for a 19-year-old prospect and is capable of putting balls out to the opposite field with ease. He has above-average big league raw power as a teenager and his 2023 contact rates were encouraging, especially within the strike zone, where they were better than average. When you start to incorporate visual scouting into the analysis, though, things are a little less stellar. Collier's odd bat path traverses the bottom portion of the zone and he's very vulnerable against pitches at the belt. His internal clock at third base isn't well calibrated, and his throws to first base are often rushed and inaccurate or arrive late. The barrel-chested 19-year-old has a maxed-out frame and could conceivably slide to first base. As solid as Cam's on-paper contact rates are, even if they hold at their current level all the way up the minor league ladder, they are in the bottom third of the current first base player population. It's very important for him to improve on defense. Without any preconceived notions about Collier as a result of his amateur fame, he has a strong data-driven profile but a fairly shaky visual one.","kdwhhNLX_OM","sa3020131"

I'd usually be inclined to ignore offensive performance immediately following a hamate surgery, but Valera's injury track record has now become long enough to reconsider his grade. He's historically whiffed at rates right near the bottom of what is viable for a big league corner outfielder, and it's imperative that his plate discipline and power play like plus attributes if he's going to reclaim the luster of a strong side platoon option on a good team. 
Valera has a sweet looking (but not especially practical) lefty stroke with considerable low ball loft. He swings underneath a ton of high fastballs and pitches on the outer third, enough that he ran a sub-70% contract rate. On defense, Valera's feel for center field is pretty good, but his speed and range are not. He makes lots of tough reads off the bat look easy, and also often cedes ground to his corner outfielders on gappers because he isn't fast enough to get there. He could play center field in a pinch but is better in right, where his excellent arm can consistently impact the game. Valera doesn't quite have the monstrous physical tools of a Josh Lowe or Will Benson type, and so he falls behind them in the pecking order as a second-division corner platoon option.","kGbEJq13Uzw","sa3006872"

He was forced to choose between signing when he was first eligible in July of 2019 for less money than a prospect of his caliber typically would, or waiting until the following year when teams had enough verbally uncommitted pool space to give him a better deal. Cappe took the latter route, but his signing was delayed another six months because of the pandemic. It put him behind the developmental curve of a typical $3.5 million international prospect by default. 
After the super-projectable Cappe showed precocious feel to hit early during his pro career, his entire game has fallen off as he's been promoted, and he's having a rough go of things on both sides of the ball so far in 2024 even though he's repeating the Midwest League. Cappe still looks great in the uniform and has a prototypical baseball frame, but he hasn't gotten much stronger since he came to the U.S., and he's still rather thin and lacking in strength. If there's an aspect of Cappe's game that has drastically improved in 2024, it's his plate discipline. He walked 3% of the time at Low-A in 2022 and High-A last year, but has posted better-than-average chase rates so far in 2024. Cappe has shifted from SS/2B to 3B/2B, and he's been mistake-prone at the hot corner, where he doesn't look at all comfortable. It looked for a time like this was the best position player prospect in the system, but Cappe is now on thin ice.

Reading is a hitter’s haven and Dunn was in his age-25 season, so there are good reasons to be skeptical of his sudden change in output, but his underlying power metrics also took a leap, with his average and peak exit velocities (92 mph and 112 mph, respectively) cresting above the big league average. This isn't gigantic, impact power, but it’s meaningful pop for a second baseman. Dunn swings and misses quite a bit, especially within the strike zone, but he’s a dangerous all-fields hitter because of his power and ability to catch some fastballs deep in the hitting zone and punish them the other way. 
Dunn isn't an especially good defensive second baseman, nor is he versatile. He has spent a bit of minor league time at third base (including five AFL games) and in left field, but his lack of mobility and arm strength make him a below-average, second base-only defender in my eyes. This lack of versatility is the biggest barrier between Dunn and 2024 major league playing time.

After some rest and a great autumn, Wiggins' elbow barked and he had Tommy John not long before the start of the 2023 season. He already had significant relief risk prior to the injury and this pushed things a little further in that direction. The Cubs took him in the second round and gave him $1.4 million, and Wiggins rehabbed into 2024; he's begun to get his first pro reps in Mesa on the complex. 
In his most recent ACL outing prior to list publication, Wiggins' fastball ranged 96-98 across 1.2 innings. He works downhill with vertical shape, typically with about 17 inches of induced vertical break and single-digit horizontal break. Wiggins worked with four different pitches in that complex outing, and his two breaking balls (87 mph sliders, 81 mph curveballs) were operating in the high-end of the velocity ranges he showed at Arkansas. Both averaged three ticks below that in 2022 and looked nasty in his pro debut. Wiggins was already reliever-y and looks understandably rusty in Arizona.

But Kopp's ability to find the strike zone evaporated during his senior year, his velocity regressed as he desperately aimed for the zone, and he de-committed from ASU, opting instead to go to South Mountain Junior College, where these issues continued. Fresh eyes got to watch Kopp throw in the MLB Draft League and at the Combine, and rather than fixate on and grow fatigued by his persistent issues, they saw a lefty with huge arm strength and a potentially good breaking ball. Now pro scouts can't believe Kopp signed for just $125,000. 
He spent the bulk of his first two seasons working as a starter for three innings at a time before the Dodgers put Kopp in the bullpen at the end of the 2023 regular season and Fall League. Kopp sits 95-98 and will occasionally touch 100 in relief. His north/south arm slot should theoretically impart big vertical depth on his breaking balls, but the shape and velo of those offerings is inconsistent, nasty at times and hittable at others. Kopp is only 21 and long-levered leviathans like him usually take a while to hone their command.

His body composition is similar to Framber Valdez and Jake McGee — he's not skinny or sculpted, but he's still powerful and athletic. Casilla pitches at the top of the zone with his fastball, which sinks down into the zone and finds barrels. He was frustratingly wild and hittable during my in-person look and for the many scouts who have seen him during the spring. Some adjustment needs to be made to Casilla's fastball or its usage, either something about grip/release that helps it play at the belt the way he seems inclined to use it, or something that leans into his ability to sink the ball. Purely a dev project with a ton of relief risk at this stage, Casilla's arm strength and raw breaking ball quality are still an exciting foundation for a prospect his age. He has sizable upside if the Rockies can develop him.","1AUuPGtCVoI","sa3018332"

This year, Castro's hard-hit rate has exploded to north of 50% (it was 34% last year), but his overall performance has keeled off with the added strikeouts. Switch-hitters with this kind of power are uncommon and Castro does some other stuff really well. He's selective, he seems capable of toning down his approach when the situation calls for a ball in play, he's a good corner outfield defender (fringe in center), and he has a huge arm. If we extrapolate Castro's rate of promotion, he should be in Portland the second half of this year, and if he hits well there, he might have won himself a 40-man roster spot for next season. If the Sox slow play things and keep Castro in High-A the rest of 2024, it's a sign they'll try to slip him through the Rule 5.

Leahy’s cutter/slider is his sharpest, most consistent offering. It’s a firm breaker that ranges between 88-91 mph and features late two-plane break that he bends down and away to righties. He'll also throw a sweeping slider that is lighter on velocity (83-86 mph) and has lesser spin quality. His curveball is a 12-to-6er and will also show tight spin, but it’s break begins much earlier than his slider and his feel for landing it in the zone is inferior. Leahy will also mix in a rarely used power changeup (88-91 mph) that, at its best, has late dive to it. You can see why the Cardinals tried to develop him as a starter, and Leahy has a deep enough mix to keep batters of either handedness in check.

Pereira has struck out at a nearly 30% clip his entire minor league career. He swings hard and has plus power already at age 22, but his hands aren't particularly deft or precise, and his swing is kind of stiff and clunky in a way that leaves him vulnerable to several common pitch-type and location combinations (especially fastballs up, and including lots of sliders that don't quite turn the corner). Because we're talking about a left field-only defender, the offensive margin for error here is pretty slim. Will Pereira be able to consistently get to enough of his power in games to be a valuable contributor, even if it's just as the righty half of a corner outfield platoon? I buy that he could have an Aristides Aquino-style peak in him, but over time I expect that the issues with the hit tool will make him tough to roster. You could point to Pereira's early-career loss of reps due to injury and the pandemic (he signed in 2017, and by the end of 2021 had played just 109 games) as a context-driven reason to project on his hit tool. That's reasonable. But Pereira's tightly wound, muscular build is relatively maxed out for a 22-year-old and I think there's a chance he stiffens and slows sooner than is typical, so even if his hit tool levels up, his peak window might end up being short for a totally different reason. With the Yankees' current roster, Pereira, who got a 27-game cup of coffee in 2023, has a chance to earn an extended big league opportunity in 2024. Still, I think it's much more likely that Oswaldo Cabrera bounces back and claims left field for his own, or that the optionless Estevan Florial (whose swing looked different late in 2023) gets a longer initial look than Pereira, or that Austin Wells can't catch and ends up entrenched in left field, than I think it is that things will click for Pereira.",,"23695"

He's a righty-hitting corner guy who has trended down the defensive spectrum (from third base to right field) and has shown bottom-of-the-scale plate discipline (he swings at a roughly 60% rate, with walk rates between 5-6% the last two years), attributes that together are a prospecting red flag. But Veras has mashed at every level despite this. He's a .283/.335/.474 career hitter in the minors and clubbed 21 extra-base hits in 38 Double-A games to close the 2023 season while he was still 20 years old. 
Veras has monstrous raw power for a 21-year-old hitter and is capable of doing all-fields damage in games. He has hit at least 17 bombs each of the past two seasons and had 39 doubles in 2023 despite lacking great feel for airborne contact. He was a 55% groundball guy last season and had an average launch angle of just four degrees, yet still hit for huge power by virtue of his strength and bat speed. Veras' dad played pro ball all over the world for 15 years, and he's Fernando Tatis Jr.'s cousin. You can see some of the family's ability in Veras' best swings. We'll never be all-in on a prospect like this, but Veras has started to defy convention and put himself in a position to play a power-hitting role in the middle of a lineup despite his flaws.

Simon has a compact swing from both sides of the plate and takes a healthy hack for a guy his size before toning it down with two strikes.

When Cabrera arrived in the U.S., he looked surprisingly heavy already and had some terrible issues on defense, where he couldn't throw the ball accurately to first base. He then proceeded to have an incredible rebound season with the bat, slashing .350/.469/.559 on the Arizona complex before a brief promotion to Daytona. This spring, Cabrera continues to hit the baseball incredibly hard — he made some of the loudest backfield contact I've seen during all of minor league spring training. By the end of the season, Cabrera had slimmed some and looked much better on defense, showing enough arm strength to fit on the left side of the infield, but he still has pretty serious mobility issues and throwing accuracy problems on defense. Though he's playing a lot of shortstop now, Cabrera projects to third base. Athletes who are his size at this age tend not to stay at shortstop, and the ones who end up at second base are of the Nolan Gorman variety, shoehorned there to get their bat in the lineup. There's enough power-hitting upside here to consider Cabrera a potential regular at the hot corner, but there's also a ton of volatility because of the way his conditioning and defense have roller coastered during his career's prologue.","FimyhHEOQ5E","sa3018405"

Ray dominated High-A and reached Double-A last year, his first full pro season. He ended up working 113.1 innings (more than double his 2022 output across Alabama, the Cape, and pro ball combined) and tallying 138 strikeouts and a 1.24 WHIP. Ray began 2024 on the 60-day IL with forearm tightness and hasn't pitched as of list publication. 
Ray's repertoire is impressively deep for someone who hasn't been starting for very long. He works a riding fastball (with as many as 20 inches of induced vertical break) at the letters and has a deep, vertical curveball that pairs well with the fastball. Last year he added a slider, which averages 8 mph of velo separation from his curveball and became Ray's most used secondary pitch. He has very consistent glove-side command of the pitch, which garnered above-average rates of chase and miss last year, while his curveball was relegated to strike-stealing duty. But the biggest 2023 development for Ray was the emergence of his splitter as his best bat-misser. It has enough sink and tailing action that it misses bats despite often finishing in the meat of the zone. 
He isn't the caliber of athlete we typically associate with a starter, but the short-levered Ray has a consistent and repeatable arm stroke that gives him starter-quality control. Despite its carry, his fastball is a little too light to forecast him as an impact rotation arm but, other than his current injury, he's a stable backend starter/swingman prospect in the Matt Andriese mold. Ray doesn't have to be put on the 40-man until after the 2025 season, but the minute he shows he's healthy and effective at Amarillo this year, he is effectively in big league range.

He also has a mid-80s changeup that flashes bat-missing tail, but it tends to have early action that puts hitters off the scent, and Montalvo uses it sparingly. Montalvo's capacity for movement and lower body athleticism is exciting and makes me want to project on his stuff quality into his mid-20s. He's thrown a ton of strikes in the low minors and stands a good shot to be a no. 4/5 starter down the line.

He rarely expands the zone horizontally, but many of his hits came on offerings above or below the strike zone, so while swinging and missing is rare for Horwitz, when it does happen, it tends to be of the chase variety, primarily on high heaters and low breaking balls outside of the zone. He reached the big leagues in 2023, first for a cup of coffee in June, then to close out the season in September. Across that tiny sample, he didn't quite emulate the swinging strike, contact, or walk rates that made him a Triple-A standout, but considering the higher quality of his opponents, it would be unfair to call it a skid over such a short span; indeed, he “skidded” into the league-average range for all of the above.

We have been reticent to stuff Norby because of his defense. He is a very rough second base defender, with fringe range, hands, and actions. He's gotten more corner outfield run in 2024 than ever before and Norby might be bad enough at second that he ends up a corner outfield-only guy relatively soon. What has been unexpected about Norby's 2024 is his significant uptick in strikeouts; he's hovering around a 30% K% so far. This is a little less concerning when you watch Norby, whose hitting hands remain pretty slick looking. He has pole-to-pole power, pulling hanging breaking balls and spraying fastballs to the opposite field. Norby doesn't have huge raw juice — in fact, his measurable power is somewhat underwhelming. He's more about consistently creating playable in-game power with swing loft. The lack of pull-side contact against heaters is a thing to watch here but, whereas Norby's underlying data has typically been less good than his surface stats, this year the inverse is true with regard to his strikeouts.

He followed a breakout 2022 with a very solid 2023 in which he worked 128 innings of sub-3.00 ERA ball across 26 starts, all but one at Double-A Biloxi. He's an undersized righty with below average arm strength, but Rodriguez is an above-average athlete with a plus changeup and two good breaking balls, and he's now K'd 26% of upper-level hitters across a starter's load of innings. Rodriguez added a few ticks of velo in 2022 and has sustained it as his workload has increased. He sits parked in the 91-93 mph range and tends to create sink/tail action at release (which is why he can really turn his changeup over), but his (lack of) size and low-to-the-ground delivery create a shallow angle on his fastball, which makes it tough for some hitters to get on top of. 
Make no mistake, at just 92 mph on average that fastball is not an impact pitch, and Rodriguez has to rely on secondaries to get by. But all three of his other pitches are pretty good, especially Rodriguez's changeup, which generated a whopping 50% miss rate (per Synergy) in 2023. He'll mix in a variety of breaking ball speeds and shapes, as well. Rodriguez's line to the plate is incredibly direct and he should throw enough strikes to start, but he lacks precise command. That's largely why he's still evaluated as a backend guy here rather than a Gasser/Blalock type with a shot to be a no. 4 starter.",,"30161"

Bennett has a huge, statuesque frame, and his delivery is silky smooth despite a longer arm swing.

It's fine — Bennett locates his fastball up and to his arm side where it plays best with great regularity, and he's a high-probability starter prospect in part because of his excellent fastball command. Bennett has an east/west operation aided by the movement of his slider and changeup. They're both nastier than Bennett's fastball. His slider plays against lefties in part because his arm slot is tough for them to pick up, while his mid-80s changeup has plus fade; both pitches hover in the 80-84 mph range.

He suffered a severe back injury as an amateur before he signed with the Phillies for $600,000, and he's been limited to fewer than 80 regular season games each of the past two years due to a broken hand in 2022 and a strained quad suffered just a couple weeks after the Tigers acquired him from Philly for Michael Lorenzen at the 2023 trade deadline. 
While reduced sample sizes as a result of his injuries make this a bit less settled than I'd like, there are some statistical red flags here that caused me to slide Lee pretty substantially on this pass through the Tigers system. Chiefly, Lee struggles to hit fastballs. The way his swing works (he's a bucket strider with a path that tends to produce opposite field contact, in the style of a righty, less twitchy Eddie Rosario) not only makes it very difficult for Lee to pull fastballs, but to hit them at all. Synergy Sports has him hitting just .160 against fastballs 88 mph and above in a 150-pitch sample generated by tracking 2023 Jersey Shore and West Michigan broadcasts. This, in concert with my Fall League look — during which Lee was regularly getting worked by fastballs around his hands — has me pretty skeptical that this is going to work even though Lee's full-season contact data against all pitch types is closer to big league average. The big-bodied Lee needs to mash in order to profile because he'll likely be a below-average 2B/3B defender due to a lack of range and athleticism, and I think it will only get harder for him to do so as he faces better velocity and pitchers who are better at determining and exploiting hitter weaknesses.","bHu9T1Jye40","sa3017863"

His sinker is unique in that he throws from a high slot, yet he's still able to produce above-average tail and sinking action on a two-seamer that sits 93-96 mph and will touch 98 mph. It's the biggest reason he’s only allowed 12 home runs over his 173-inning professional career so far. Loutos also has a 12-to-6 curveball, and he likes to vary the amount of depth the breaker has while consistently producing solid snap to it.

He was a power-armed prep righty from Maryland who was ushered toward college by a Tommy John surgery he rehabbed from during a redshirt first year at South Carolina. He performed well throughout both healthy seasons in Columbia, with his innings total doubling from 2017 to '18. Cleveland shut him down after the 2018 draft, then asked him to make 20 starts (at a little over four innings per start) the following year, which is when he first popped up on my radar and Cleveland's prospect list. Morris was throwing very hard early in 2019, but his stuff wavered late in the season. During 2020 instructs, he was again parked in the mid-90s, up to at least 98 mph, and had a plus changeup and average curveball, but this was in a controlled developmental setting after he hadn't pitched all year. We moved Morris into the 40+ FV tier at that time as a way of indicating that he had big upside, while also factoring in the risk related to his injury track record and fluctuations in stuff. He got off to a late start in 2021 due to a strained lat, then was incredible when he first came back, punching out 36% of hitters while once again sitting 94-96 mph before dipping into the low-90s later in the year. Morris suffered a shoulder sprain during 2022 spring training and began rehabbing in July, slowly building to a month-long big league debut at the end of the season, earning a playoff roster spot in the process. Again his stuff was nasty, sitting mostly 94-95, while he made frequent use of a relatively new upper-80s cutter and finished hitters with his signature changeup. 
Morris' inability to stay healthy has made it tough for him to log starter-level innings as a prospect. As with Bo Naylor, the Guardians never optioned Morris after he was initially called up, preserving all three of his option years. Having bought themselves that extra time, they could theoretically continue to develop him as a starter, but Morris is ready right now. Deploying him in relief allows him to make an immediate impact on a competitive big league club and might help keep him healthy, and you can still ramp up his workload over time via a multi-inning relief role that gives him a long-term path to being a starter.",,"25388"

Why the bearish projection then? Zavala has a bottom-hand dominant swing that causes him to cut underneath an awful lot of fastballs in the zone. This is an issue that tends to be exposed more thoroughly as hitters climb the minors, and that's what is anticipated here. Zavala ran a 67% contact rate in 2023, which is near the bottom of the acceptable big league range, and he posted it against Low-A pitching. The strikeout issues here make Zavala very volatile and are reminiscent of the way Jeter Downs looked as a lower-minors hitter. His OBP skills and power will need to carry all the way through the minors in order for him to profile as an everyday player, and at Zavala's modest size, his raw power will probably settle closr to average. 
There is a positive development here, and it's Zavala's defense. Previously projected to a corner outfield spot, his range and ball skills are a fit in center field. Zavala's ability to play center field is very important to his overall profile and if he can become an impact defender out there, it will raise his floor as a player to that of a part-time outfielder. There's substantial bust risk here, which is baked into the way Zavala is graded.","qrQHMA3MKhQ","sa3015718"

Roden hit .383/.484/.640 in two seasons at Creighton and slashed .317/.431/.459 in a 2023 season split across High- and Double-A. He had more walks than strikeouts prior to promotion and a miniscule 5.2% swinging strike rate on the season. The Blue Jays have already drastically altered Roden's swing, and he now has the same very upright, Craig Counsell-ish stance followed by a big leg kick that Barger does. It's a good-looking swing and squeezes as much as is possible out of Roden's modest athleticism, but the change hasn't elevated his power to a place that profiles in left field. You can really limit his damage by staying away from him and throwing Roden fastballs, which he doesn't lift as well as secondary stuff. On top of that, Roden's feel for contact is a little artificial, and has more to do with his short levers than precise timing and barrel feel.

Palmquist struggles to command his heater to his glove side, which makes it tough to set up his slider as a chase pitch. Still, his level of funk, as well as his mechanical looseness, athleticism, and repertoire depth look like they could work through a lineup a couple of times, especially if Palmquist uses a more even mix of pitches than he did in college when he was fastball-heavy.

Arias has gotten plenty of experience at both up-the-middle infield positions, where he shows quick, soft hands and fluid actions. It’s not an ultra quick-twitch operation, but Arias looks well-suited to be able to handle shortstop, as well as the other infield positions long-term. He only wields average arm strength at present but his quick release allows it to play up, and Arias has a well-calibrated internal clock. Considering how underdeveloped his frame remains, it’s a good bet he'll add a tick more on his throws as his frame matures and he gets stronger.

He hit (this is not a typo) .414/.461/.771 as a junior and more than doubled his career home run total with 21 bombs. Why wasn't he a first rounder? His swing might not play in pro ball. Anderson is great at identifying and barreling low pitches, but his path is often underneath stuff at the belt and above. He's often bent at the waist and spraying contact to the opposite field with his bottom hand-dominant swing, and he rarely pulls the ball (a common trait among hitters in this system). When he connects, Anderson puts a huge charge into the baseball, it's just possible he won't connect enough in pro ball. 
He saw action all over the infield in college and was fine at both second and third base; after the draft, he only played second base at Lakeland. Even if he's flawed as a contact hitter, so long as Anderson can play two spots, he has enough power to carry a part-time infield profile. However, the track record of players who enter this system with hit tool question marks and come out the other end having answered them has not been great lately.

His diminutive frame and lack of a clear position (his throwing accuracy from second base was pretty wild) pushed him to the 2022 draft's fourth round. Meidroth has more or less coasted to Triple-A before his 23rd birthday while producing absurd OBPs, just over .420 throughout his pro career. 
There are a handful of guys in the minors with this kind of profile: extreme contact and on-base ability undercut by a lack of power and defensive utility. Chase, ironically, Meidroth does not. He has fantastic plate discipline and is chasing at only a 20% clip so far in 2024, which is an improvement on his already excellent 2023 rate. He's also really hard to make whiff. His compact stature aids in this because it keeps his swing short, but he also has great hand-eye coordination and bat control. He has a minor league leading 2.7% swinging strike rate in 2024 and is putting balls in play five times as often as he's swinging and missing. Meidroth will tomahawk the occasional high pitch with extra base power, but most of his contact is of the low-lying variety, with lots of oppo pokes and slaps. It's pleasing to watch, but isn't especially impactful. Baseball Savant's minor league statcast data has Meidroth with a .321 xSLG this year. It's pretty rare for hitters who slug under .400 to carry elite OBP skills into the big leagues for an extended stretch; there really aren't any long-career hitters with OBP north of .400 whose slug is below it the last 20 years or so. Jamey Carroll's offensive output is a pretty good proxy for what to expect from Meidroth — it's enough for him to be a big league role player but probably not a Steven Kwan sequel despite the swinging strike excellence. 
Defensive versatility is going to be important to roserting Meidroth consistently and he's been playing 2B/SS/3B this year. He lacks typical middle infield range, athleticism and arm strength, but his hands around the bag are pretty good and Meidroth's throwing issues from college have subsided. He looks most comfortable at third base and is below-average at second. This is a very fun role-playing infield prospect who is in line to be part of Boston's part-time 3B/2B mix if Rafael Devers moves to first base.

Woods Richardson's fastball lost a couple of ticks in 2021 and lived around 90 mph until 2024, when he's had a three-tick bump and is suddenly averaging 93 mph. His command, as well as the ride and deception created by his perfectly overhand trebuchet delivery, helps his fastball punch a little bit above its weight class. His slider usage has also ticked up in 2024. The change in his approach to pitching and an across-the-board uptick in velocity hasn't made any of his pitches play like a plus bat-misser, and he relies on his slider to induce weak contact. If there's a concerning regression here, it's that SWR's changeup, once projected as a plus pitch, has looked pretty generic for the last two years. He commands it, but it lacks the powerful tailing action it showed at peak. It's usually hard for pitchers with a due north arm slot like Woods Richardson's to turn over their changeup, and as his velocity and the whip and looseness of his arm action have slipped, so too has the pure quality of his cambio. A rebound in this area will be a key for him hitting his ceiling. There's no plus pitch here, but there are four viable offerings that all move in different directions, as well as sentient command of them all.

His swing path has both loft and bat speed, but his ability to produce consistent hard contact is hindered by his pitch selection. Additionally, it’s not uncommon for Luciano to take such large hacks in hitters' counts that he loses his ability to manipulate his barrel to cover multiple quadrants of the zone and he greatly sacrifices his ability to make contact in the process. Luciano has played all over the dirt since entering the pro ranks, but he doesn't project to be an above-average defender anywhere, with third base the position that his solid-average arm and fringe quick-twitch abilities profile at best.

He had something of a 2022 breakout in a piggyback starter role at Low-A en route to an incredible 2.39 ERA in the Cal League. His 2023 season was interrupted multiple times by injury — an AC joint sprain and a tweaked hammy — and McDonald only threw half as many innings as the year before. He looked healthy and effective at the end of the campaign and was added to San Francisco's 40-man roster after the season. 
McDonald began 2024 on the IL with a groin injury. We suppose you could consider him injury prone, but McDonald hasn't had persistent, recurring ailments — his issues are all over the board. He hasn't necessarily been missing out on building a starter's stamina because his arm action, which is ultra-short, relatively stiff and odd looking (Jason Adam is a fair delivery comp), as well as a fairly inefficient approach to pitching with his fastball, seemed likely to funnel him toward the bullpen anyway. His collection of secondary stuff gives him the repertoire depth of a bulk relief or swingman. McDonald has been sitting 93-95 when healthy for the last three seasons and has a big-breaking, low-80s curveball that has overwhelmed lower-level hitters. His changeup has consistent below-the-zone finish and McDonald could stand to use it more often.

This is the Colombian giant's eighth appearance on a prospect list, as he's remained relevant as a middle relief prospect due to his arm strength and, more recently, his breaking ball consistency and changeup. Zuñiga has long sat in either the mid- or upper 90s depending on the night. His velo was down several ticks from last year prior hitting the IL with a pec strain. His feel for locating his slider (which bends in anywhere between 81-91 mph) has improved, and its spin rate spiked a couple of years ago, as if he found a new grip or release.

At his size, Wolkow is likely to end up at first base, or at least near the very bottom of the defensive spectrum (the White Sox played him in center and right field during his post-draft stint on the complex), so he needs to get to most of that power. Prior to the draft, he was evaluated as more of an power-driven flier of extreme variance rather than a high-probability big leaguer. If Wolkow and the Sox can quiet his operation and get his contact rates into a range with more big league precedent (he had a 66% contact rate against high school pitchers in Synergy Sports' sample, which is at the very bottom of the demonstrated range of major league viability), or if he can show that he's going to get to huge power while striking out 35% of the time, then we'll re-evaluate.",,"sa3022817"

Hurley is often a bit overzealous on the field, whether it's what he decides to swing at or how often he decides to show off his arm. He can move the bat head all over the zone, it's just that Hurley's swing isn't always well-connected when he does. He tends to poke grounders up the middle when pitchers locate at the bottom of the zone. He's also a little bit chase prone, which impacts Hurley's contact quality more than it causes him to swing and miss. At the top of the strike zone, he is dangerous to all fields. 
Eric's pre-draft eval thought Hurley ran well enough to stay in center field (at Virginia Tech, he ran some 4.00s with a jailbreak, usually a max-effort 4.15) and has the arm to be an all-around impact defender in right if he has to move. He's played a lot of left field so far in 2024, which may partly be due to a minor leg injury (from which Hurley quickly returned) and the presence of developmental center fielder Andrew Pintar in Hillsboro. That's a situation to monitor, but for now, Hurley remains projected as a viable center fielder. His approach creates some risk, as Hurley likes to swing, but lefty sticks with this kind of power/speed combo tend to find their way into an oft-used part-time role. Hurley projects as a modern fourth outfielder who gets 350 or so annual plate appearances as part of an effective timeshare.",,"sa3022564"

He does most of his swing-and-miss damage with a low-90s fastball that averaged 90 mph across all of 2023. He was sitting more 90-94 during his postseason starts with Wake, but has been back in the 88-91 mph range during the spring of 2024. 
In college, Sullivan's repertoire was fastball-heavy in the extreme at about 75% usage, which isn't sustainable in pro ball when you sit 89. His mid-80s changeup appears to be coming to the forefront of his secondary offerings early in 2024. Sullivan sells it with arm speed and tends to command it to the arm-side edge of the plate. His slider isn't nasty on its own, but his arm angle is going to help it play against lefties and it has enough length to play as a strike-stealing backdoor offering versus righties. There aren't many starters who look like Sullivan in the big leagues — guys like Ryan Yarbrough and Reiver Sanmartin can kind of give you an idea of the role pitchers like Sullivan tend to play.

Healthy Crow has also shown murderous command. He hammers the zone with his upshot fastball and two different breaking balls, throwing basically all of his pitches for strikes at a 70% clip in 2022.

His stuff and command have backed up a bit since then as the Dodgers and Yankees (Beeter was the prospect return for Joey Gallo) have deployed Beeter as a starter en route to a post-2023 40-man roster add. 
Beeter's delivery is stiff and his release is inconsistent, generating relief projection here for the last several years. He tilts out to create a vertical arm slot that helps impart the carry on his fastball (which often sails to his arm side) and the depth on his two breaking balls (which he actually has a better feel for landing in the zone than his heater), but Beeter has never had great feel for release and has run double digit walk rates for basically his entire career.

Dowd is sitting 89-92 as a starter and his two most-used secondary pitches — a mid-80s changeup and slider — are both below-average pitches that he has commanded well enough to sport an ERA just over 3.00 at Charleston as of list publication. What's encouraging about that is that Dowd's best pitch is his curveball. It appears he is forcing himself to pitch off of his two worse secondary offerings in an effort to develop them rather than lean on his knee-buckling curveball, which was maybe the best breaking ball in the entire 2023 draft. His changeup has been used especially frequently. Dowd isn't great at creating movement on either his changeup or slider, but he is pretty good at locating them. As good as his curveball is, its effectiveness is more about spin efficiency and plane than raw spin, and so its excellence won't necessarily translate into a good slider (his slider has about 2,300 rpm on average). Dowd's vertical arm slot has long helped his fastball play at the belt, and that pairs nicely with the curveball.

Offensively, Harris makes a lot of low-lying opposite field contact. His downward-cutting swing often drives the baseball into the ground, and though he's tended to produce above the league average at each of his minor league stops, it has come as Harris has been quite old for the level to which he was assigned.

The best-case outcome for someone like Harris is a career similar to Matt Duffy's, where his hit tool holds water in a profound way and he's able to play a glove- and contact-driven role for many years.

Healthy Pintar would run 4.10 home to first and hit searing doubles into the oppo gap. Back to start 2023, Pintar played at Visalia for just a couple of weeks before he got hurt again, this time rolling his ankle over a bunted ball. The ball slipped just under his glove as he bent to field it and rolled right beneath his foot. It was a gnarly, severe-looking injury to the foot/ankle that caused him to miss two and a half months.  
His arm strength sapped from the shoulder issue, Pintar is realistically a second base-only defender on the infield. His speed gives him a shot to play center field and he's now being developed there at High-A Hillsboro. He's made some tough plays there despite his inexperience but at other times looks a bit tentative, as you might expect considering how recently he converted. Pintar's time off may also cause him to be rusty on offense. His hands start and stop and start again, and his entire operation could use some smoothing out.

Humphries has shown two budding breaking balls that are tough to distinguish out of hand. His delivery has some head whack to it, and he was walk-prone on the complex last year before he was promoted to A-ball down the stretch.

Kuehler is a smaller-framed guy with medium athleticism. Despite a very short arm action, his release varies in a way that impacts the shape and consistency of his 81-84 mph breaking ball.

Reilly has a high-waisted, medium frame that is still on the lean side, so there’s some room for additional strength/weight in the coming years. Reilly works out the stretch, there's substantial effort present in his delivery, and he throws from a very high slot, which contributes to the 20-plus inches of induced vertical break on his heater. His four-seamer sits 92-95 mph and has touched up to 97 mph so far in 2024, and it features plus riding life that has generated a 35% miss rate as of our data sourcing a couple weeks ago. It’s a power-over-precision operation with his fastball, which is an offering he doesn't need to be overly precise with due to the effective life it features. He'll throw sliders with downer action as well as some with more of a horizontal tilt. The cutter is a short, quick offering that Reilly especially likes to run in on the hands of left-handed hitters; it will be a very important pitch for him because the minimal action on his changeup makes it tough to project as a viable pitch for him. 
It makes sense to stretch Reilly out and see what happens, but if we're predicting his outcomes, they likely fall in relief. He already has a reliever look with the amount of effort his delivery requires, and we think his fastball could jump a grade by maximizing velocity in short, one-inning bursts.

Instead he struggled with walks for two months before he was shut down with a forearm strain in early July. 
Santos is still frail looking. He is physically and mechanically similar to Jesse Chavez, utilizing a short-striding, low-slot delivery. These factors, plus Santos' track record of relatively poor strike-throwing, point to the bullpen. Optimists can point to Santos' excellent slider command, as well as his combination of youth and athleticism, as hopeful indicators that he can start. Santos's low slot creates sink and tail on his fastball, and he doesn't yet have good feel for running this shallow-angled pitch up the ladder. His changeup is still not awesome, but its usage and quality took a step forward in 2023, and you can continue to project on it based on Santos' athleticism. There is still a greater developmental distance for Santos to travel than other arms in Toronto's system, even the relief-only prospects. Santos definitely has more positive variance (aka higher ceiling) than those older relievers but, especially coming off the injury, he has a lower floor as well.

To my eye, his swing is geared for contact with low-and-away pitches and that's kind of it, and his in-the-box operation reminds me of former White Sox prospect José Rodríguez. 
On paper, he's been a much better hitter than that during his young minor league career. He held his own as an 18-year-old in Modesto last season and had a .904 OPS there in 2024 before earning a recent promotion to Everett. It's possible that at a short-levered 5-foot-8, what looks to my eye like mechanical length is made sustainable by Arroyo's (lack of) size. Still, I'm more inclined to trust my eyes than I am to care about Cal League performance. I think there's a swing change that could unlock better plate coverage, and it's possible I'm just wrong, but I wouldn't be confident taking Arroyo back as the centerpiece of a blockbuster trade at this stage. 
Tightly wound, I'm more sure Arroyo isn't a shortstop. He has decent range but can't position his body to make all the throws from there. He has the hands, range, and arm strength to play the other infield positions and might even have the speed for center field.

His frame lacks significant projectability, but he has yet to fully grow into mature strength, and there’s clearly athleticism in his movements on both sides of the baseball. Um hits out of a square, balanced stance and uses a leg kick stride. He lacks much of a load in his hands (which may be covering up some untapped power) before unleashing intent-filled hacks that have loft in their path.

His ability to tighten up that aspect of his approach will be an influential variable for the future of his hit tool. 
Defensively, Um stays quiet with his wide one-knee setup and presents borderline pitches well. His blocking ability is still quite inconsistent and he doesn't always deaden balls in the dirt even though he looks to be a solid lateral mover.

He never really looked himself even when ""healthy,"" though his stuff has been so up and down since college that at times it's difficult to know which Burke is the real one. Peak Burke struck out 31% of opposing hitters at Double-A Birmingham in 2022; for most of that year, his fastball was parked in a career-best 93-95 mph zone while touching 97. You could project heavily on his strike-throwing (which wasn't great, even when he looked his best) and his secondary pitches because he was a serious multi-sport high schooler (hoops) who also missed a year of college reps because of TJ, and as a result was much less experienced than most other college prospects when he was drafted. Now that we've had years of mixed velo and injury, it's prudent to project Burke in the bullpen. 
His impact heater has top-of-the-zone utility, and it's the best weapon in Burke's four-pitch mix. Usage of his mid-80s slider/cutter has ticked up in pro ball, becoming Burke's best secondary pitch, while his changeup and curveball are deployed less frequently. Even though Burke's curveball can be easy to identify out of hand, it became more surprising for hitters to see once it became his third pitch, and it actually garnered the best whiff rate of all of his offerings when he was last healthy for a long period of time. It's possible a bullpen move will mean scrapping his changeup. 
The 2024 season will be Burke's 40-man evaluation year, and if he's healthy and back to throwing hard, we expect he'll be added after the season and play a multi-inning role starting in 2025. Because we're talking about a shoulder injury here, we'd like to see him healthy before pushing his FV grade back into the 40 or 40+ tier.","kIgHNMwtCh0","29878"

His plus arm strength allows him to complete any play on the dirt, his hands work well enough to handle sharp grounders to both sides of his body, and his body control allows him to handle slow-rollers in front of him. As we noted last year, Vasquez is a good enough athlete that he might really benefit from gaining outfield experience in an effort to add as much versatility to his game as possible, particularly with his offensive development starting to lag behind. Willy is still young for a Double-A player and we're mindful not to let prospect fatigue slip in too much here, but the hole in his swing feels like it's going to be a long-term issue.

The Dodgers took him in the second round, Knack signed for just over $700,000, and he's pitched exclusively as a starter in affiliated ball, amassing a career-high 100 innings in 2023. He's dealt with more injuries in pro ball — a couple hamstring strains and an unspecified 2023 injury — and his velocity has waxed and waned somewhat, with his fastball averaging just 92 mph in 2023. Knack came into 2024 camp in better shape and was parked at 94 mph in early games. His fastball plays down a bit because of its angle, so it's important for him to throw hard. 
Knack makes heavy use of a mid-80s cutter/slider that he commands the best of all his pitches.

I'm less likely to bucket him as a reliever out of hand, but Knack's sobering injury history is important to consider. Even if he can start, we're likely talking about a backend role, pretty similar in value to an on-roster reliever.

Woessner has a potentially plus breaking ball (especially if it also gets faster in a shift to relief) and would be a quick-mover as a three-pitch bullpen weapon, but the Brewers have lots of other comparable relievers tracking ahead of his 2026 debut timeline and there's no reason to rush him in such a role.

But Olivar's offensive performance has been similar to last year's in most facets, except he's hitting more home runs and is on pace to nearly double last year's total. It will mark three consecutive years of impressive offensive output from the powerful youngster, who has a rather well-rounded skill set for a potential catcher. 
Olivar's frame is muscular, bordering on maxed out, and will need to be kept in check as he traverses the minors, especially since we're talking about a currently below-average receiver who needs to stay mobile and flexible to execute other aspects of catching well. He has the arm for it but will need to develop as a pitch framer. The Twins have given him run at several other positions, most recently left field, as well as second base and center field in the past. Occasional time in the outfield might enable him to back into some positional versatility and give him a better chance of contributing to a roster since there probably isn't enough impact here for Olivar to be the primary catcher.

He throws both a four-seamer (92-96 mph) and sinker (92-94 mph); the sinker shows average tail and sinking action while the four-seamer has solid carry through the zone. His go-to pitch is his changeup, which ranges between 83-87 mph and features very late bottom action. It routinely slips under bats and is exceptionally hard for hitters to identify because of the arm speed with which he throws the pitch. The changeup is also an offering he shows advanced feel for, as reflected in the 47% whiff rate and 43% chase rate the offering produced in 2023. Sanchez will infrequently show you an 84-86 mph slider that tends to have tilt to it, but it has below average tightness and best projects as a pitch he can drop it to steal strikes on occasion.

Rios doesn't have the prototypical offense of a corner outfield prospect, and his best chance to profile is by improving at the catcher position. He's catching about a quarter of the time so far in 2024 and looks predictably raw. He's a one-knee, bottom-up receiver, and has a tendency to stab at pitches that miss the location where he's set up. This needs to quiet down, and Rios' ball blocking needs to improve. There are amateur scouts who liked Rios' bat enough to give him a shot in an outfield corner. He was especially good at getting on top of high fastballs in college, but his hand path, which is remarkably similar to Keston Hiura's, is not the kind for which this is typically true. It's possible Pac-12 pitching just wasn't good enough to expose the upper-zone hole in Rios' swing (which seems to be true early on in 2024 as he K's north of 30% of the time).

Bush and the Padres have made some changes to his swing and approach in an attempt to coax something more out of his offense than he showed at Grand Canyon. He's got a closed stance and dives to the outer part of the plate to cover pitches away from him, and Bush is now using a bat with a weighted knob.

Only about half of his offerings were in the zone (and that includes balls that were just slightly out of the zone, but still likely to be called strikes), and his out-of-zone chase rates weren't high enough to make up for it. 
What makes the wavering command most frustrating, though, is the quality of his stuff. His curveball, long considered a gem, is his best weapon for getting swings out of the zone with its plus vertical depth. He uses a more traditionally shaped slider to enhance his ability to deploy the curveball, and his changeup is deceptive thanks to his consistent arm speed. It’s a deep arsenal that somewhat mitigates the inconsistency of his fastball, which will vary in velocity and shape to the point that it’s dangerously hittable when offered up against advanced hitters.
The missed time – which has largely been due to complications from the TJ, rather than additional, unrelated injuries – and strict pitch-count limits resulted in a total of just 31.2 innings of work from the former second-rounder in 2023, and the persistent stopping and starting made it difficult for him to put together a string of dominant starts at any point in the season. But he put up better numbers during his time in the AFL, and his stuff, in particular his curveball, is tremendously enticing and could already be a viable weapon in a big-league bullpen, where his inconsistent fastball could be less of a thorn in his side.",,"sa3014713"

The Pennsylvania high schooler was one of the toolsier prep players available, a big-framed center field prospect with rare athleticism and power projection, and fair batted ball showcase performance for a cold weather guy. Detractors were scared of how cacophonous Montgomery's swing was and thought he'd need an overhaul to hit at all in pro ball. Model-driven teams rounded down on Montgomery because he was nearly 19 on draft day. Even though Montgomery's swing was odd, he still put balls in play at a pretty good rate against his elite peers. The Rockies picked him eighth overall. Montgomery had a big first full season on paper (.313/.394/.502) aided by a .419 BABIP and the hitting environment in the Cal League, but he K'd at an alarming rate. That carried into 2023, when Benny's output dipped closer to league average. 
I don't see how this is going to work in an everyday capacity unless Montgomery's swing changes. His hands are incredibly noisy and active in a couple different directions while the ball is in flight, and I fear he's going to be very strikeout-prone now that he's reached the upper minors. He still runs well enough to be developed in center field and should be fine there if he can refine his ball skills, which have looked raw in the past but have been better early in 2024. He needs to take another step forward as a defender in order to hit this projection, but I have Montgomery in as a Jake Marisnick/Keon Broxton type of reserve outfielder.","qAoY6aE313M","sa3017169"

Canario's power is very impressive. He's capable of hitting balls out to all fields and posted a whopping 53% hard-hit rate when healthy in 2023. Similar to Yankees outfield prospect Everson Pereira, Canario's swing-and-miss issues give us substantial pause when it comes to projecting his role. His tendency to misidentify sliders against righty pitchers destabilizes his entire profile and is probably going to limit his role to the short side of a platoon where he's mostly facing lefties. He's best at hitting hanging breakers and spraying high fastballs the opposite way. A stiff lower half makes it tough for Canario to bend and do damage in the bottom of the zone, though we're hoping this changes as he gets further away from his severe injuries. Here we have Canario projected as a 200-ish PA corner outfielder who gets situational starts and in-game at-bats against lefties or, to get even more metagame-y, against pitchers who live at the top of the strike zone.

The bread-and-butter of his pitch mix is still a 78-82 mph curveball, a sharp vertical downer that is more than capable of generating whiffs against both left- and right-handed hitters. Mozzicato maintains his fastball arm action and speed when throwing a 81-84 mph changeup that produces a modest amount of depth, but like much of his arsenal, it is hindered by his lack of control.

So far in 2024, Graceffo’s fastball is sitting 90-95 mph (way down from peak), but the offering plays lighter than that due to a lack of movement or outlier life; it's more reliant on being precisely located to be effective, which he’s been unable to consistently do at Triple-A.

He also keeps a rarely utilized changeup in his back pocket. It has fade, but the action begins almost right out of his hand and is another pitch hitters don't seem to have any issues picking up early.

His breaking balls run the gamut from upper-80s cutters to mid-70s curveballs, all with bat-missing finish when located. He's a breakout candidate if, during rehab, the D-backs find a way to make his fastball play a little better in the zone and can help a solidly average big league athlete (Hitt moves really well getting off the mound) with a typical frame and build find a way to have starter-quality command. He projects as a fifth starter, with fastball quality Hitt's most influential developmental variable.",,

The Dodgers acquired him from the Yankees as part of a 40-man crunch trade during the early portion of the 2023-24 offseason that sent Jorbit Vivas and Victor González to New York for Sweeney, who doesn't have to be 40'd until after the 2024 season. 
Though the Yankees only ever deployed him at shortstop, Sweeney is slower and heavier-footed than the typical big leaguer there. Some of the sweet looking plays he makes at the very extremes of his range an average big league shortstop would make look more routine. Sweeney is built like Josh Jung, and it's rare for an athlete that size to be an impact shortstop glove. Here, Sweeney is evaluated as a below-average shortstop defender, and his ultimate role will likely be a heavier mix of second and third based on his skill set. 
This has been the crux of Sweeney's defensive evaluation at FanGraphs since his draft year, and now we've also cooled a bit on his bat. His hands have so much pre-swing movement that we worry he won't consistently be on time against major league fastballs, and stiffness in Sweeney's lower half makes it difficult for him to scoop lower pitches. His underlying bat-to-ball performance (like his 8% 2023 swinging strike rate), propensity for airborne contact, and consistently excellent plate discipline is all evidence to the contrary, and it's plausible adjustments will coincide with the change of scenery. Sweeney tracks pitches very well and check a lot of heuristic boxes (left-handed, performed immediately as a pro despite his small school background) that we tend to like, but he doesn't have an impact tool or play a premium position well, so he profiles more as a reserve infielder.",,"29575"

He slugged his way out of Low-A in the first half of 2024 and was promoted to High-A shortly before list publication. 
Figueroa has a very entertaining lefty uppercut swing that generates huge pull power. He's allergic to spin and is hitting .135 versus breakers in 2024 as of list publication. Already approaching the line between muscular and thick, Figueroa is going to have to keep his build in check to remain at third base. He has the arm to play there but the plays he tries to make tend to unfold too slowly and result in superfluous bang-bang plays at first base. A 1B/3B defensive combo probably keeps Figueroa on the roster as a part-time corner slugger if he can continue to improve his defense.

Albright wasn't an especially projectable or athletic high schooler, but he did have good natural breaking ball movement for a prep lefty, and he now has two different breakers, including a pretty hard slider that looks like it's coming to the forefront of his repertoire.

In his first full pro season, Wagner slashed .239/.342/.405 with a 26% K% in a year split between High- and Double-A. He had offseason surgery to remove a fractured left hamate and began 2024 on the shelf. He's struggled at the plate since returning to Bowie in mid-May. Hamate surgeries are notorious for impacting a hitter's performance upon return, sometimes for months as the player strengthens their hand, so we're not dying to nuke Wagner's evaluation even though he's striking out a ton right now. We like the verve in his hitting hands and think there's enough all-fields damage happening here to offset some of the in-zone whiffs. 
On defense, Wagner plays a mix of second and third base. He has enough arm for third, but his 40-grade hands and range are kind of an issue at second. There's a Mike Brosseau type of big league utility here, as Wagner will probably end up playing another corner position or two and be deployed against lefties as often as possible.

He's young but has a relatively maxed out frame, and the way he trends athletically in the near future is going to be important to his defensive fit and his overall role. 
Areinamo has one of the more entertaining right-handed swings in pro baseball. It is evocative of the way Yuli Gurriel's masterful stroke looks through contact, but Areinamo's pre-swing gesticulations are unique to him. Even though he's a thicker guy, Areinamo is a gifted rotational athlete with WD-40'd hips whose offensive operation is about the way his body moves more than raw strength, which he lacks. He can move the barrel all over the place but expands the zone far too much. While he's often bailed out by his hand-eye coordination and barrel feel, Areinamo's tendency to swing at balls both hurts his OBP and also leads to a lot of weaker contact even though he's putting the ball in play a ton. 
As a poor defensive second baseman, he needs more than just one good offensive tool to succeed. I'm smitten with his rare hitting skill and swing aesthetic, but something has to change or develop here for Areinamo to be a big leaguer. He either needs to hit for more power, be more selective, or improve his defense in terms of quality and versatility. Strength and conditioning changes might be a catalyst for a couple of those things. There are still two full seasons before Areinamo's first 40-man decision, so it's really the 2025 season by which I'd like to see tangible improvement here.",,"sa3015802"

Funderburk hides the ball well and the flat line on his heater is tough for hitters to get on top of when he locates to the top of the zone. This version of his fastball often has natural cut, but Funderburk also has a sinker variant with drastically different movement. The split in horizontal movement between these two pitches helps to keep him off the barrel and generate a ton of grounders.

His desire to pull everything often causes him to swing inside sliders that don't quite turn the corner, and he ran a 69% contact rate in 2023 (which is not good) even as his strikeout rate improved.

The lack of life and movement on the four-seamer gives McGreevy little margin for error with its location. The slider is still McGreevy’s bread and butter. When it's at its best, it shows sharp two-plane action, but he hasn't yet shed his tendency to get on the side of it, where it turns into a far more lateral-based breaker without snappy depth to it. His curveball is a deep vertical breaker that lacks the sharp, late break his slider will produce, but it offers a vastly different shape and velocity range from his other offerings. McGreevy’s changeup has minimal velocity separation from his heaters at 84-88 mph, but his ability to mirror his fastball arm speed makes it a tough pitch for hitters to identify out of the hand early despite it’s tendency to lack notable action.

So he’s swinging more (but not too much), and missing less, which speaks to the improvements he’s made at the plate. The extra swings simultaneously led to fewer walks and more slugging, resulting in roughly the same OPS as 2022. The majority of his hits come on pitches within a horizontal band just above his belt, and most of his overall swings come in that area of the zone as well. He rarely expands the zone, displaying a keen ability to lay off breaking balls below it – particularly impressive given his age. That he can be selective at the plate is a good thing, but it may mean that there are holes within the strike zone that more advanced pitchers would be able to exploit, so it behooves him to diversify the pitches he can connect with as he advances. 
Defensively, De Jesus still sees time at shortstop but he’s unlikely to stay there due to his comparative lack of range, and we've had him projected to third base here for a while now. He has difficulty finding a handle on the ball and getting it out of his glove cleanly when he’s on the run, and he sometimes gets ahead of himself in that regard, trying to get the ball out of his glove before it’s even in there, resulting it in clanging off the heal or exterior.

Some of his fastballs dipped down into the mid-80s at times, but Hoffmann showed an ability to miss bats with all three of his pitches and the Braves used a 12th round pick on him. After he signed, Hoffmann's velocity stabilized, and he sat 92-93 mph for the rest of 2021 and was in the 93-95 range in 2022 prior to being traded to the Royals for a comp pick in that year's draft. 
Hoffmann has a long (6-foot-5), lean frame and a drop-and-drive delivery. He routinely mixes up the pace and leg kick elements of his delivery to create additional deception. His fastball sits 92-96 mph and has solid riding action when he works it above the letters, but it also has a tendency to get flat when thrown lower due to the angle that his delivery creates. He often manipulates the shape on his 81-85 mph slider, showing a tilting three-quarter version and a wider slurvey variant, both of which share above-average sharpness in their break. The third pitch in Hoffmann's mix is a 85-88 mph changeup that usually shows slight fade along with a hint of sink, flashing more pronounced action on his best ones. Hoffman looks destined for a up/down starter and/or bulk relief role. If any element of his profile can outperform its projection, he could have a Burch Smith type ceiling.",,"sa3017202"

He was especially dominant against High-A hitters (15.2 K/9 with Bowling Green, 8.8 K/9 with Montgomery), who struggled to parse Montgomery's oddly paced, deceptive delivery. In 2023, Montgomery made 29 starts, the last handful at Triple-A, amassing a total of 124.1 innings. Over those frames, he struck out 26.8% of opposing batters while walking 11.2% and finished the year with a 3.98 ERA. He is struggling somewhat at Triple-A in 2024 and has an ERA over 6.00 as of list publication. 
Montgomery throws from a high slot. His four-seam fastball sits in the 91-95 mph range and touches 97 mph on occasion. His high front side and ability to hide the ball during his arm path allows his fastball to sneak up on hitters, especially in the upper parts of the zone. His slider (which Monty added in pro ball in lieu of his college curve) is a 82-86 mph two-plane breaker with late break and average tightness, while his 84-86 mph changeup has shown minimal depth but not significant enough action to believe it has a ceiling higher than being an average offering. Montgomery projects to have fringe-average command overall (but plus command of his slider) and has a back-end starter ceiling if the changeup is able to consistently play to average; otherwise, he'll be better suited for middle relief. This is a pretty substantial dip from the no. 4/5 projection of last year's list, but it seems like mechanical deception was allowing him to dominate the lower levels, while upper-level hitters haven't had as tough a time parsing things.",,"29770"

His is still not a great receiver, but he's been slowly improving in this area for two years (he was pretty bad before the Peralta trade). His ball-blocking is still pretty bad and needs to improve. 
Cerda checks a lot of the visual scouting boxes for a catcher with his big frame, on-field leadership (which is currently more about big energy than field awareness), and above-average bat speed, which makes Cerda a dangerous low-ball hitter. Cerda has also posted multiple years of high-end walk rates and his underlying data suggests he is indeed a very discerning hitter. His issues getting on top of pitches in the upper half of the zone will probably cause his walk rate to come down as he climbs the minors because pitchers have an area of the strike zone they can attack with impunity; they won't need to nibble. This is a fair developmental catching prospect who has prospect clout due to industry inventory at his position. He's probably going to be a very slow burn.",,"sa3015623"

He's more often been deployed in a single-inning capacity in 2024 and dominated the Sally League before a recent promotion to Double-A. Hales' approach to fastball location in college didn't make a ton of sense and he's working more at the top of the strike zone with his heater as a pro. The horizontal split between his fastball and slider makes it tough for righties to cover both sides of the plate, creating some hamate-threatening action in on their hands and a lot of awkward takes against his slider.

Smith has a deceptive, low-slot delivery that hitters struggle to pick up, and he imparts nasty rise-and-run action on his fastball, which bores in on the hands of righty batters. When Smith is locating to that high, arm-side location, he is nearly unhittable, but he doesn't repeat his violent delivery very well and he scatters fastballs all over the place.

In 2024, he's been chase-prone, but he gets to his power when he makes contact and is running a SLG-driven OPS of .780 at time of publication. That's what readers should expect from Willems going forward. He's a free-swinging lefty stick who takes a big uppercut hack. Willems' peak exit velos are plus (he hit a ball 116 mph this year) and he averages 20 degrees of launch. He's short levered and able to ambush high pitches. A combination of chase and the in-zone holes in Willems' swing are going to result in lots of strikeouts. He really struggles with soft stuff down and away from him, and his bat path also looks vulnerable down and in, but A-ball pitching isn't executing to him down there. Were Willems more likely to stick at catcher, this would be okay. He has a pretty good arm, but badly needs to improve as a ball blocker and receiver.

The infield is a less natural fit for him, as his hands aren't especially good. O'Rae has a proclivity for oppo contact and was very difficult to make whiff last year. It's contact of the low-impact variety and will probably stay that way because of his lack of size.

Sugastey also doesn't have great pure arm strength, but his exchange is rhythmic and consistent — he's a threat to hose you because of accuracy more than velocity. Even when catchers have monster tools, plate discipline this poor still creates risk and volatility — think Jorge Alfaro and Francisco Mejía.

When he did make his professional debut in 2021, he wasted no time displaying his offensive prowess, slashing .333/.458/.538 in 17 games on the complex. He’s steadily climbed the ranks of the system since then, splitting his 2022 more or less evenly between Low- and High-A, then spending the bulk of 2023 at Double-A before finishing out the season with a strong 20-game Triple-A stint. He’s consistently posted a wRC+ well above league average at every minor league stop, with his hard-hitting power an obvious stand-out trait, bolstered by savvy swing decisions and a patient approach that allows him to be selective at the plate and wait for pitches he knows he can crush. Palmegiani’s thump is largely of the pull variety and is most effective against fastballs, with 16 of his 23 home runs in 2023 (the most in the system from anyone not named Orelvis) coming on heaters, most of which were belt high, while the offspeed and breaking balls he sent out were mostly hang ‘em, bang ‘em mistakes from the pitchers. Defensively, he had spent most of his time at third base, but has never been a particularly comfortable fit there, and since reaching Triple-A, he has seemed to be more firmly planted at first base. His ability to punish pitchers for mistakes and pulverize fastballs to his pull side are good things to be sure, especially when he’s demonstrated patience, but doing so off of a greater variety of offerings will likely be necessary for him to carry his obscene offensive numbers up to the big league level.

He was well regarded despite industry consensus that he'd need a swing overhaul in pro ball and seemed likely to be a slow-burning developmental project, especially for a college hitter. But the possibility that he'd turn into a left-handed-hitting George Springer was very enticing, and the Marlins selected him 35th overall in the 2019 draft. Misner made some mechanical tweaks, was traded to the Rays for Joey Wendle, and reached Triple-A while maintaining his power-over-hit reputation. 
Misner can put balls out to all-fields with the flick of his wrists, and the changes he's made to his swing since college (a bigger leg kick, hands loading further away from his body and out over the plate) have helped the power play in games. He's consistently struck out at a 30% clip and his strikeout woes continued in 2023 during a season spent in Triple-A Durham, where he punched out in 35.8% of his trips to the plate, walked at a 17.5% clip and slashed .226/.363/.458 with 21 homers and 21 steals (77.8% success rate). He's having a similar season there again in 2024. Misner's outward, rhythmic hand load creates built-in length to his swing, which has significant loft and is geared for elevating pitches down in the zone. It leaves him vulnerable against offerings that crowd him and as well as anything up in the zone. 
Misner is above-average defender in both corner outfield spots, while his range in center is average at best. While he’s capable of handling center field, he’s best suited to filling that role temporarily and isn't someone you want playing there for long stretches. His strikeouts are going to prevent Misner from playing any kind of regular role, but he's a threat to leave the yard and is a versatile outfield defender.

He is much more physically mature than most other pitchers his age, his build more akin to a catcher's, so there isn't an obvious path toward more velocity here. That will be fine if Martinez can maintain his current level of arm strength and simply develop crispier secondaries. He hasn't been consistently healthy for a minute, but Martinez is a good young pitching prospect to monitor when he returns.","G-LuHlVb5kk","sa3016026"

He's out the gate very hot at Lansing to start 2024, chasing less often than he has throughout his career, albeit across a small sample. Simpson's carrying tool is his all-fields power. He's enormous and strong, and able to generate impact pop in a short mechanical distance. Simpson isn't the most skillful barrel-control guy — he lives off being in the hitting zone for a long time and having the strength to hit the baseball hard even when he's a little late. Righty-hitting first base profiles are tough, especially when Simpson is likely to have a below-average hit tool at peak (even if his plate discipline improvements are somewhat real). But he has big league thunder in his hands and, because of some of the other good stuff he does at the plate amid all the strikeouts, he seems pretty likely to tap into that power in games. Simpson has just begun to play some third base at Lansing, something he didn't do at all in college.

Rodriguez still has some developing to do in center field. He's only been playing there regularly for two seasons and while he has the pure speed to play there, he doesn't always look comfortable catching the baseball.

Rather than sit 92-95 mph and bump 97 like he would in high school, Miller's fastball is averaging just shy of 92 mph the last two seasons, including early in 2024. This is pretty typical for high school pitchers whose throwing schedule and innings count become more labor-intensive as pros, and the hope is that through physical maturity they can at least maintain their high school velocity, if not improve upon it. Because Miller isn't the most projectable young guy, this is less likely to happen for him. 
Miller's secondary stuff is generating slightly above-average swing-and-miss. His slider and changeup both reside in the 83-86 mph range most of the time, and the slider is a nice east/west complement to Miller's two-seamer.

He did a better job of keeping the ball in the park in 2023, allowing just 1.31 HR/9, but he surrendered hits at a higher clip than in previous seasons, though that may largely be due to a slew of soft contact and a .375 BABIP, much higher than he’s posted previously. His fastball sits 93-96 and plays up due to the incongruity between its shape and his release point, resulting in whiff and chase rates in the mid-30s on the heater.

He threw it slightly more often in 2023, too, with the slide piece accounting for 21% of his pitches (up from 18% in 2022), but it was his changeup that saw the more drastic increase in usage. His cambio usage jumped from 18% to 30% in 2023, in particular against lefties. As with the fastball, both secondaries play up because the arm slot is so funky, but being funk-dependent puts pressure on his command to be effective. His walk and strikeout rates were virtually the same as they were in his shorter 2022 Triple-A stint, with both moving incrementally in the respective right direction, but he still needs to tamp down the walks, which are sitting in the 11% range.

It's unclear if Nett has two or three different breaking balls. He definitely has a curveball (which has good depth, but is easy to spot out of hand) and might have both a slider and cutter. The velo band of the sliders/cutters is wide enough to assume he has both (81-91 mph), but Nett's feel for release is so crude and the movement on these pitches is so variable that it's possible they're versions of the same pitch.

In the couple of seasons since then, he was sent from San Francisco to Chicago as part of the Kris Bryant trade, experienced a velocity spike, and saw his command (once projected as a 70-grade attribute) regress somewhat (due to a stylistic shift) en route to his 2022 big league debut. He came out this spring throwing incredibly hard, touching 101 in one of his three two-inning outings (one start, two in relief) before an MRI revealed a teres major strain in his right shoulder, which will shelve Kilian until close to the middle of the 2024 season. We consider it pretty likely he'll just be put in the bullpen when he returns to preserve his last option and manicure the rest of his 2024 innings load.
Kilian will work with a nasty two-seamer that eats right-handed batters alive on the inner third. He also throws a four-seamer that at times has natural cut, as well as a more overt cutter in the upper-80s. He could reach back for velocities peaking in the 97–99 band as a starter but tended to sit in the 93–97 range. If we're correct in speculating he'll be a reliever when he returns, then we expect he'll sit 97-101 like he was prior to his shoulder issue. After showing a precise east/west style of pitching early in his pro career, Kilian has begun to take a less efficient north/south approach, especially with his four-seamer. He doesn't have a plus, bat-missing secondary, so pure velocity is his best way of punching hitters out, and he may pare down his repertoire if he shifts to the bullpen. He'll frequently show you a 77–82 mph curveball, but that pitch is as much about stealing early-count strikes as it is about finishing hitters off. Without a swing-and-miss secondary, we forecast Kilian will be a fastball-heavy multi-inning reliever eventually, though probably a single-inning option as he first works back from injury.","E2pDNeZBu40","26213"

The graceful 6-foot-7 righty was Cleveland’s 2022 first rounder, but he has yet to throw a pro pitch at an affiliate because he was shut down post-draft and then had surgery in May 2023 to relieve pressure on his ulnar nerve. Now he's rumored to be undergoing Tommy John in the spring of 2024, which would shelve him for yet another season. 
Campbell had premium extension/approach angle traits, a plus changeup, and a starter-worthy command foundation when he was drafted, characteristics that have him primed to explode if he can reach and maintain greater velocity in pro ball, which is becoming more common for college arms. Oklahoma State has also not been very good at maxing out their pitchers while Cleveland has. The crux of Campbell's projection in this area is his size. At a graceful 6-foot-7, Campbell releases the ball right on top of hitters, and he still has room to fill out and maybe throw harder. His low-90s fastball (which peaks in the 95-97 mph range) has riding life at the letters, he can turn over an above-average changeup even from his high slot, and he can create vertical depth on a pretty vanilla low-80s slider. If he can throw harder, he'll probably end up having more of a power, mid-80s breaker. 
Now we'll be waiting until 2025 to see him. There's a gap between Campbell's healthy projection (which was that of a 45 FV player) and his present trade value (this grade), which is impacted by multiple years of severe injury. Campbell is impossible to evaluate and so is tough to ""value"" as if he were part of trade discussions, but because his stuff has been all elbow while Daniel Espino's issues have been more varied and have involved his shoulder, there's a gap between those two otherwise very talented fellows here.","kiHeNQqPbDU",

His hands are soft and he’s very comfortable completing plays on the run; his above-average body control allows him to make tough, mobile throws with ease and accuracy. 
In the batter’s box, Devanney hits out of an upright, open stance with a high-hands setup before loading them down and away from his body prior to launch. There’s a lot going on in Devanney’s operation prior to the actual swing, but he has solid bat-to-ball skills that he uses to spray contact into both alleys despite having bat speed that's average at best. Devanney’s defensive ability at a premium position is what causes him to be a high-confidence up/down type; whatever he provides with the bat can be considered supplemental value.",,"sa1170010"

His fastball averaged 92.9 mph in 2023, but the offering's above-average carry gives it a higher perceived velocity than its radar gun reading. Ultimately though, the offering plays closer to average overall due to the lack of control he has of the pitch. The headliner of Albright’s mix is a downer curveball that features plus sharpness to its break and has a significant velocity separation (79.5 mph in 2023) from his fastball. He'll also show a cutter that has a tendency to back up on him and turn into a spinner. Some of those pitches still freeze opposing hitters, even when they back up.

Fox took to center field pretty well. He doesn't have elite range, but his ball skills and reads are surprisingly good considering he hasn't been playing there very long, and he has an impact arm. A successful revisitation of the infield is going to be key for Fox's development because it would give him plus defensive versatility and impact, and he's unlikely to have another plus tool on his scout card. Fox does have deft feel for contact, but the quality of that contact is so poor due to his lack of power that his hit tool will probably play down a bit. Fox is on the smaller side and isn't especially explosive. He swing features big, slow movement in his lower body but short action with his hands, and he can alter the posture of his upper body to put the bat on the ball (which is a trait common in this system).

Hernández generates a lot of torque with his hips and throws surprisingly hard for a softer-bodied dude, sitting 95-98 and touching 100.

He has dealt with health issues since college, which, along with the pandemic, prevented him from playing more than 45 games at any single affiliate in a given season until 2022, when he had an awful 66 wRC+ at Round Rock and was left off Texas' 40-man roster. He rebounded in 2023 with 30 homers, but he was only a hair above the league average in terms of overall offense. Injuries to Josh Jung and Justin Foscue facilitated Wendzel's big league debut in April and he now has enough big league roster days to lose rookie status. 
He's cut his Triple-A strikeout rate in half via a swing change. Wendzel's hack now looks like a carbon copy of Foscue's, with more of a toe point stride than his previous leg kick, and a super shallow load to keep him short to the ball. Wendzel is an above-average third base defender with experience at several other positions, but he lacks the physical tools to play them unless it's an emergency.

White's offensive profile is built around his above-average bat strength, with his approach geared towards selling out for power. While he does a good job of keeping the ball off the ground, he’s not making productive, authoritative contact in the air regularly enough to actualize his raw power. White will give glimpses of how much he’s capable of punishing the baseball, and given the athlete he is, there’s room for optimism that the in-game power production will progress the more at-bats he’s able to accumulate.

Those two pitches give Prosecky a reliever's foundation. He's a bit of a short strider and his arm stroke isn't always well-timed, but so far Prosecky has thrown enough strikes to continue developing as a starter. His third pitch is currently a changeup, which is still below average but has long-term ceiling because of the whip of Prosecky's arm stroke.

Cruz throws from a high three-quarters arm slot that helps to create above-average carry on his four-seamer, but the pitch plays well below its velocity and life grades overall due to his poor command. It's a similar story with his sinker, which has average tail and sink to it. Cruz’s bread and butter pitch is a changeup that features significant late fading action and will also flash depth. Cruz does a good job of maintaining his fastball arm speed when throwing his changeup to add an extra element of deception, but again, it's a pitch that he’s unable to consistently control, which makes him overly reliant on hitters chasing out of the zone.

Why no upward revision to Stewart's grade then? I'm apprehensive about how he'll perform against upper-level fastballs, both in terms of their velocity and his opponents' ability to locate to the upper part of the strike zone, which Stewart is not as good at covering. He is also a well-below average athlete and third base defender who approaches grounders in front of him too slowly. Stewart has started to see time at second base, where most of a player's duties are comprised of feeding and operating around the second base bag and moving side to side. Maybe that will be a better fit for him but, athletically, it would be a non-traditional, mold-defying one if it works out. Stewart does track pitches well, makes terrific adjustments to breaking balls, and moves the bat around the bottom two thirds of the zone with advanced feel. He hits the ball hard but not in the air as often as you want a below-average corner defender to. Stewart's build is maxed out and it's unlikely there's much more raw power on the way even though he's only 20. 
Improved mobility on defense (there have been no signs of that this spring) or Stewart simply ""proving it"" against Double- and Triple-A stuff in the next couple of years are the means by which I'd consider upping this grade.

They did so knowing he'd need Tommy John, which he had shortly after signing. Finally back in the fall of 2020, Zulueta was topping out in the 94-96 mph range at Toronto's facilities in Florida, then threw even harder in the spring of 2021, when he sat 96-99 as a non-roster invitee with the big club. He made it all of three pitches into his first start before he tore a ligament in his knee, needed surgery, and missed the remainder of the season. The 2022 season was Zulueta's 40-man evaluation year and the Blue Jays pushed him very aggressively up the minor league ladder (as a starter), such that he made starts at each full-season minor league level, including Triple-A. We pretty confidently projected Zulueta in the bullpen last year and he made it about a month into the 2023 season before the Jays moved him there, which was a refreshing departure for the org that kept starting Nate Pearson even while their big league bullpen could have used a weapon like him. What we failed to anticipate was that Zulueta's command would be so bad that Toronto would DFA him before the 2024 season; he was claimed by the Reds.
While Zulueta's delivery isn't especially violent, it also isn't especially graceful or smooth, and his feel for location is so bad that he's unlikely to reach the late-inning ceiling his stuff suggests. The Reds have already altered his delivery somewhat — Zulueta's formerly big, distracting glove motion upon hand break has been toned down and he seems to be a little deeper in his lower half as he drives home. It hasn't immediately aided his consistency at Louisville. He's an older dev project hanging onto the 40-man by a thread, but he'll probably get many chances to figure things out because he has premium arm strength and breaking ball movement.","yXnObtaHqUc","27765"

Del Castillo has an all-fields-oriented approach with a bat path that is geared more for gap doubles than it is consistent over-the-wall juice. His stroke is more smooth than explosive. He can golf down-and-in pitches to his pull side and tends to work the oppo gap against fastballs that catch the meat of the plate. It's fair plate coverage that's bolstered a bit by a discerning eye for the zone, fine for a reserve catcher. On defense, Del Castillo is fair across the board. His arm strength is a tick below average, but his clean and consistent release allows him to produce average pop times with real feel for accuracy on his throws. His receiving around the edges of the strike zone is usually quiet and clean, and Del Castillo is a suitable ball-blocker when moves his feet, though he still tries to backhand pick too many pitches to his right. Without a plus tool on offense or defense, Del Castillo is more likely to be a third catcher on the 40-man who will try to earn a long-term backup job over time.",,"29554"

Jebb has split time between second base and shortstop. He’s shown his hands are solid enough to handle both, but he has fringe arm strength at present and is a better fit for second base. Jebb’s contact ability and quality will need to get back on track for him to project to anything beyond a low-tier bench utility type, and ideally we'd like to see him play defense at positions besides second base.

Then Espino's health began to spiral. He was shut down with a knee injury early in 2022 and started having shoulder issues during his rehab. Those shoulder issues have snowballed and Espino had surgery for a capsule tear in May of 2023, then was revealed to have more capsule and rotator cuff issues at the start of 2024 that required yet another surgery. When he next pitches it will have been at least three years since his last competitive inning. Spring 2022 Espino was one of the best pitching prospects I've ever seen, but his career officially feels like it's on thin ice now, as he's had chronic shoulder problems spanning multiple seasons, something pitchers tend not to recover from. I feel especially bad for Espino, who appeared to take tremendous and disciplined care of himself before all of this started to transpire, but it's also a loss for the rest of us, as we've been robbed of the chance to witness something pretty special unfolding in Cleveland.","WCe2LI0RvgA","sa3011495"

Caro is the type who is capable of more juice in game action than he is in BP because he’s lacking in pure strength and benefits when the pitcher is supplying some velocity in the equation. There’s natural loft in his bat path without sacrificing the amount of time it stays in the hitting zone, and he’s a pest for pitchers thanks to his ability to grind out at-bats. 
Defensively, it’s a profile that is limited to second base due to his below average arm, and Caro projects to just be passable at the position overall. This is the type of player who is held back from a bench infielder projection because he’s only able to handle one position on the dirt, and at a fringe-average level at that. Regardless, Caro is a fun player worth knowing because this is the type of guy who squeezes every drop out of their physical ability. Caro has an all-or-nothing puncher's chance to be a primary second baseman, and his performance is trending in a favorable direction.

Two years later, when he was old enough to be an age-eligible sophomore, there were scouts who thought Jones had the best tools package in the entire 2019 draft, but still his bat-to-ball track record and inconsistent defense made clubs uncomfortable, and he wasn't taken until the back of the first round. For five years now, Jones has remained that kind of player. He struck out in 35% or more of his plate appearances every year since he was first promoted to Double-A. Last season at Triple-A Durham, Jones had his first above-average wRC+ in a while as he got to enough power to post a .357 wOBA. Given Wander Franco's legal situation and Taylor Walls' health, the Rays could not afford to have a 26-year-old developmental shortstop on their roster and traded Jones to Colorado for lefty Joe Rock not long before the 2024 season. 
It's rare for me to have a hitter this old on a prospect list, or a hitter who has struck out north of 35% of the time, let alone both. But Jones has elite speed, he's a viable shortstop defender (but not a great one), and I think his athleticism will translate to center field in a big way over time. I think the Rays took too long to deploy him there (they waited until he was 25) and, amid some absolutely insane highlight reel plays early on in 2024, his relative inexperience still shows. He needs to communicate better with the corner guys, take charge of 50/50 balls in the gap, and be more decisive about where the baseball needs to go. These are problems of inexperience. As a shortstop, Jones' range is incredible, and while his throwing stroke is atypical for a big league shortstop, he finds improbable ways to get the ball over to first base using his body control. This guy is going to hang around the upper levels of pro ball for a while longer just because he's athletic enough to play two premium positions, and while he's limited on offense (he punishes the fastballs he connects with, but is otherwise hapless), the tools for Jones to make a situational impact on a big league roster are still here.","jsjX_1SuPjY","25448"

Furman's full season staline illustrates his skills pretty well. He hit .264/.397/.306, and as you can imagine, he has an extreme hit-over-power skill set. 
The ceiling on Furman's offense looks something like Adam Frazier's career, and similar to Frazier, Furman is not a very good second base defender. He's speedy and should be able to run around in the outfield if the Guardians are inclined to try that, as they have with some other players. A 2B/LF mix could put Furman more in line with the Tony Kemp archetype, though Kemp is a much better second base defender. Barring meaningful development on defense (like if Furman suddenly takes to center field like Jake Fox did last year), Furman's outcomes are probably binary: either he sustains elite contact ability and gets to be a flawed everyday second baseman, or not.

Because he's so new to a rotation, he may just be scratching the surface in some pitchability areas (that's where the changeup projection is derived from here), but Vanderbilt isn't a school that tends to leave developmental meat on the bone, and it's rare for pitchers moving from the 'pen to the rotation to add velocity, something McElvain will ideally do.

Like a lot of Red Sox hitting prospects, Jordan is better at contacting pitches at the top of the strike zone. His swing is relatively simple and compact, helping him be on time consistently. Jordan has had close to average big league raw power since he was in high school, and because he was physically mature early on, his raw remains in that area.
He's playing a mix of both corner positions. He's a smooth third base defender with elegant footwork and a knack for making accurate throws.

It was a breakout year for him since Trimble was a draft-eligible ""freshman"" whose first collegiate season was wiped out by COVID.

Injuries have limited him to about 70 games in the three years leading up to this season, with a torn labrum the worst of these, a hamstring injury the most recent. 
This is still a pretty explosive guy who swings hard for a player his size. Both Trimble’s swings have minimal loft and are more geared for line drives than home runs. He shows above-average bat speed from both sides, though it takes him a ton of effort to generate it. Trimble is capable of playing all three outfield spots at an above-average level, with efficient routes and quality jumps. He looks most comfortable playing center, which is likely a product of his experience there compared to the corner spots. Trimble’s development track has been slowed by injury and his offensive profile projects to be well short of an everyday role, but his above-average defensive chops and versatility have him destined to be an above-replacement outfielder.

Because he's played other spots and missed most of 2020, his long-term ceiling as a first base defender could be very high once he focuses solely on the position. In the box, Melendez works out of a slightly open stance with a high-hands setup. He has a simple leg lift stride, and a profile that's oriented more to bat strength than bat speed. His bat path has significant loft and length to it, and because he doesn't have above-average bat speed, he consistently gets beat by velocity that’s not down in the zone and right into his path. His below-average plate discipline (34.8% chase in 2023) and on-base ability mean nearly all of his value relies on his game power, which is hard to see him fully tapping into because of the hit tool and plate discipline issues.

On offense, Fulford has a pull-oriented approach that leads him to swing inside a lot of sliders. He's got pretty good power for a catcher and is most dangerous in the down-and-in portion of the zone. He should be in the mix for third catcher duties soon.",,"sa3017164"

As such, Pinto pitches backwards a lot, and scouts tend to think he'll end up in long relief because he is doing from the beginning of outings what most starters do the second or third time through the order. Pinto has a catcherly build and is an open strider with a long arm action. His walk rate ticked up in 2022 and has been increasing since he entered full-season ball, while his spin rates have keeled off (a 200-300 rpm drop from both his fastball and slider compared to 2021).

This is a vert slot lefty with a good changeup who has been given a new, harder breaking ball this year. Rogers has always worked in an inefficient way at the top of the zone with his fastball, but his new mid-80s slider/cutter should theoretically be helping him get some weak early-count contact. Instead he's issuing free passes at a 13% clip. Still, four-pitch lefties with mid-90s heat aren't exactly a dime a dozen.

This isn't to say that Pinango isn't a prospect. The stout, hard-swinging 22-year old has pretty good plate coverage and posted contact rates and peak exit velos right around the major league average last year. That isn't spectacular for a left field-only defender without physical projection (let alone one repeating a level), but Pinango's all-around offense makes him an above-replacement type.

The experiment that saw him transition from third base to center field last year seems to be over, and Vuk has been playing the corner outfield in 2024.

He's a dangerous gap-to-gap hitter with this simple operation, which looks as though he's using a two-strike approach the whole time, expertly guiding the bat head around the bottom of the zone. Campbell does have trouble with up-and-away fastballs at times, and right field is a tough profile when you don't have a plus offensive tool.

The biggest caveat, of course, was that then 23-year-old hadn't yet faced the quality of pitching that might be able to expose his grooved swing. Early on in 2024, it appears that's begun to happen, as he has been ice cold for the first six weeks of the season. McGeary is a stiff guy whose swing cuts through the middle of the zone. He's a fairly discerning hitter and is dangerous when he gets a mistake to hit, but he lacks great feel for moving the barrel around. When, very early on in his pro career, it looked like he might still catch, some of these issues were more palatable.
